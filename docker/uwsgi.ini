; set the socket listen queue size, in production the suggested value is 1024, however RHEL based kernels have a max of 128 by default
; you may need to increase the somaxconn parameter in your kernel
listen = 128

; If using subdirectory hosting e.g. example.com/nautobot, you must uncomment this line. Otherwise you'll get double paths e.g. example.com/nautobot/nautobot/.
