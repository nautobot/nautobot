    in the job.

    part of the parent job_form block to be rendered (in this case).

    Even though we want full control over the rendering of the job form, we do need
    to render the form object (as opposed to the parent template) so so that all of 
    the submit functionality (queues, approval required, etc) is included. We can 
    exclude fields from the render so that the fields defined above are not re-rendered
    here. Here we are going to exclude the `custom_job_data` field since we've rendered
    it above.
