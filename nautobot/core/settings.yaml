  ALLOWED_HOSTS:
    default: []
    description: >-
      A list of valid fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) and/or IP addresses that can be used to reach the
      Nautobot service. (If provided as an environment variable, it should be a space-separated string, for example
      `NAUTOBOT_ALLOWED_HOSTS="localhost 127.0.0.1 nautobot.example.com"`)
    details: |-
      Usually this is the same as the hostname for the Nautobot server, but can also be different; for example,
      when using a reverse proxy serving the Nautobot website under a different FQDN than the hostname of the
      Nautobot server. To help guard against [HTTP Host header attacks](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/security/#host-headers-virtual-hosting),
      Nautobot will not permit access to the server via any other hostnames or IPs.

      Keep in mind that by default Nautobot sets
      [`USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#use-x-forwarded-host)
      to `True`, which means that if you're using a reverse proxy, the FQDN used to reach that reverse proxy needs
      to be in this list.

      !!! warning
          This parameter must always be defined as a list or tuple, even if only a single value is provided.

      Example:

      ```python
      ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['nautobot.example.com', '192.0.2.123']
      ```

      !!! tip
          If there is more than one hostname in this list, you may also need to set
          [CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS](settings.md#csrf_trusted_origins) as well.

      If you are not yet sure what the domain name and/or IP address of the Nautobot installation will be,
      and are comfortable accepting the risks in doing so, you can set this to a wildcard (asterisk) to
      allow all host values:

      ```python
      ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
      ```

      !!! warning
          It is not recommended to leave this value as `['*']` for production deployments.

    details: |-
      The [`django-redis`](https://github.com/jazzband/django-redis) Django plugin is used to enable Redis as a
      concurrent write lock for preventing race conditions when allocating IP address objects.
      Nautobot also uses the built-in [Django cache framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/cache/)
      (which also relies on the `CACHES` setting) to perform caching. This includes caching of the values of
      [administratively configurable settings](#administratively-configurable-settings) as stored in the database.

      !!! tip
          Rather than directly setting `CACHES["default"]["LOCATION"]`, we recommend managing this setting via
          the various `NAUTOBOT_REDIS_*` environment variables, as those variables apply to both `CACHES` and
          [`CELERY_BROKER_URL`](#celery_broker_url) alike, which is typically preferable.

      +++ 2.3.4 "`NAUTOBOT_CACHES_TIMEOUT` environment variable"
          Added support for the environment variable `NAUTOBOT_CACHES_TIMEOUT` for configuring the
          `CACHES["default"]["TIMEOUT"]` setting. This environment variable also controls the cache timeout
          for administratively configurable settings.

      Nautobot requires access to a supported database service to store data.
      This service can run locally on the Nautobot server or on a remote system.

      Nautobot supports either MySQL or PostgreSQL as a database backend. You must make sure that the `ENGINE`
      setting matches your selected database backend or **you will be unable to connect to the database**.
    details: |-
      !!! note
          Nautobot supports all database options supported by the underlying Django framework.
          For a complete list of available parameters, please see the
          [official Django documentation on `DATABASES`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#databases).

      !!! warning
          By default, MySQL is case-insensitive in its handling of text strings. This is different from
          PostgreSQL which is case-sensitive by default. We strongly recommend that you configure MySQL to be
          case-sensitive for use with Nautobot, either when you enable the MySQL server, or when you create the
          Nautobot database in MySQL. If you follow the provided installation instructions for CentOS or Ubuntu,
          the recommended steps there will include the appropriate database configuration.

      !!! tip
          When using MySQL as a database backend, and you want to enable support for Unicode characters like
          the beloved poop emoji, you'll need to update your settings.

          If you try to use emojis without this setting, you will encounter a server error along the lines of
          `Incorrect string value`, because you are running afoul of the legacy implementation of Unicode
          (aka `utf8`) encoding in MySQL. The `utf8` encoding in MySQL is limited to 3-bytes per character.
          Newer Unicode emoji require 4-bytes.

          To properly support using such characters, you will need to create an entry in
          `DATABASES` -> `default` -> `OPTIONS` with the value `{"charset": "utf8mb4"}` in your `nautobot_config.py`
          and restart all Nautobot services. This will tell MySQL to always use `utf8mb4` character set
          for database client connections.

          As of Nautobot 1.1.5 and later, if you have generated a new `nautobot_config.py` using
          `nautobot-server init`, this line is already present in your config and no action is required.

      Each broker consists of a name, the class it uses for publishing events, and the topics
      it filters. Topics are the categories of events that a broker will publish or exclude
      based on the provided filters.

      Example:

      ```python
      EVENT_BROKERS = {
          "SyslogEventBroker": {

              },
          },
      }
      ```

      In this example:
      - **SyslogEventBroker** is the broker name.
      - **CLASS** specifies the path to the event broker's Python class.
      - **INCLUDE** filters the events the broker will publish, such as all topics starting with "nautobot.test."
      - **EXCLUDE** filters out specific topics like those with "no-publish" in the name.

      !!! note
          If **INCLUDE** is set to ["*"], all topics will be published unless excluded by **EXCLUDE**.

      ```

      To exempt _all_ models from view permission enforcement, set the following.
      (Note that `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` must be an iterable.)

      ```python
      EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS = ['*']
      ```

      !!! note
          Using a wildcard will not affect certain potentially sensitive models, such as user permissions.

      and the value should be set to the permission [constraints](../guides/permissions.md#example-constraint-definitions),
      or `None` to allow all objects.

      Example:

      | Permission | Description |
      |---|---|
      | `{'dcim.view_device': {}}` or `{'dcim.view_device': None}` | Users can view all devices |
      | `{'dcim.add_device': {}}` | Users can add devices, see note below |
      | `{'dcim.view_device': {'location__name__in': ['HQ'], 'location__location_type__name__in': ['Building']}}` | Users can view all devices in the HQ Building |

      !!! warning
          Permissions can be complicated! Be careful when restricting permissions to also add any required
          prerequisite permissions.

          For example, when adding Devices the Role, Device Type, Location, and Status fields are all required fields
          in order for the UI to function properly. Users will also need view permissions for those models or the
          corresponding field selections in the UI will be unavailable and potentially prevent objects from being
          able to be created or edited.

      The following example gives a user a reasonable amount of access to add devices to a single location
      (Building HQ in this case):

      ```python
      {
          'dcim.add_device': {'location__name__in':  ['HQ'], 'location__location_type__name__in': ['Building']},

      !!! warning
          For backwards compatibility with storage of Job inputs in prior versions of Nautobot, this
          currently defaults to using `DatabaseFileStorage` to store such files directly in Nautobot's database;
          however this is not typically the best option (see below) and may change in a future major release.

      If your Nautobot server instance(s) and your Celery worker instance(s) share a common
      [`MEDIA_ROOT`](#media_root) filesystem (as would typically be the case in a single-server installation of
      Nautobot) then we recommend changing this to `"django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage"` to store
      Job files on the filesystem (which will place them into a `files/` subdirectory under
      [`MEDIA_ROOT`](#media_root)) instead of in the database.

      If your Nautobot server instance(s) and Celery worker instance(s) do _not_ share a common filesystem,
      we recommend using one of the [`django-storages`](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) options
      such as S3 to provide a storage backend that can be accessed by the server(s) and worker(s) alike.

      !!! tip
          For an example of using `django-storages` with AWS S3 buckets, visit the
          [django-storages with S3](../guides/s3-django-storage.md) user-guide.

      If you have neither a common `MEDIA_ROOT` filesystem nor an appropriate remote storage option, then
      it's permissible to leave this at its default, but know that storing files in the database is provided here
      as a "least-worst" option only.

      !!! caution
          It's typically safe to change this setting when initially updating to Nautobot 2.1.0 or later, as
          there should be no pre-existing Job output files, although any existing scheduled Jobs that have
          file _inputs_ may need to be deleted and recreated after doing so. However, once you've run any Jobs
          that output to a file, changing storage backends will of course break any existing links to
          Job output files in the previous storage backend.
          Migrating Job stored files from one backend to another is out of scope for this document.

      [various means](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html) such as setting the `PYTHONWARNINGS`
      environment variable. However, doing so can be rather noisy, as it will also include warnings from within
      Django about various code in various package dependencies of Nautobot's, etc.

      This configuration setting allows a more targeted enablement of only warnings from within Nautobot itself,

    description: "A dictionary containing the configuration settings for logging in Nautobot."
    details: |-
      The default translates to:

      * All messages from Django and from Nautobot of INFO severity or higher will be logged to the console.
      * If [`DEBUG`](#debug) is True, Nautobot DEBUG messages will also be logged, and all Nautobot messages
        will be logged with a more verbose format including the filename and function name that originated
        each log message.

      The default log formatters split each log message across two lines of output for greater readability,
      which is useful for local observation and troubleshooting, but you may find it impractical to use in
      production environments that expect one line per log message. Fortunately, the Django framework allows for
      extensive customization of logging format and destination.

      Below is an example configuration extension which will additionally write all INFO and higher messages to
      a local file:

      ```python
      LOGGING["handlers"]["file"] = {
          "level": "INFO",
          "class": "logging.FileHandler",
          "filename": "/var/log/nautobot.log",
          "formatter": "normal",
      }
      LOGGING["loggers"]["django"]["handlers"] += ["file"]
      LOGGING["loggers"]["nautobot"]["handlers"] += ["file"]
      ```

      #### Available Loggers

      * `django.*` - Generic Django operations (HTTP requests/responses, etc.)
      * `nautobot.<app>.<module>` - Generic form for model- or module-specific log messages
      * `nautobot.auth.*` - Authentication events
      * `nautobot.extras.jobs.*` - Job execution (`* = JobClassName`)
      * `nautobot.core.graphql.*` - [GraphQL](../../platform-functionality/graphql.md) initialization and operation.
      * `nautobot.extras.plugins.*` - App loading and activity
      * `nautobot.core.views.generic.*` - Generic views which handle business logic for the web UI

      #### Structlog Configuration

      As of Nautobot 2.3, [django-structlog](https://django-structlog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is added as a core dependency. To use structlog, you can add the following code to your `nautobot_config.py` file:

      ```python
      from nautobot.core.settings_funcs import setup_structlog_logging

      setup_structlog_logging(
          LOGGING,
          INSTALLED_APPS,
          MIDDLEWARE,
          log_level="DEBUG" if DEBUG else "INFO",
          root_level="INFO",
          plain_format=bool(DEBUG),  # Set to True to use human-readable structlog format over JSON
          debug_db=False,  # Set to True to log all database queries
      )
      ```

      Calling this function disables logging if running tests, otherwise:

      * Overwrites all `formatters` and `handlers` to avoid logging duplication.
          It's possible to add custom `formatters` and `handlers` after calling this function.
      * Updates all `loggers` to use structlog with the specified `log_level`.
      * Adds or updates the root logger to use structlog with the specified `root_level`.
      * Uses a human-readable structlog format if `plain_format` is True, otherwise uses JSON.
      * Adds database query logging if `debug_db` is True.
      * Adds necessary Django apps and middleware for structlog.

      Recording of login times will resume when maintenance mode is disabled.

      !!! note
          The default [`SESSION_ENGINE`](#session_engine) configuration will store sessions in the database,
          but this obviously will not work when `MAINTENANCE_MODE` is `True` and the database is in
          a read-only state for maintenance.  Consider setting `SESSION_ENGINE` to
          `django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache` when enabling `MAINTENANCE_MODE`.

      !!! note
          The Docker container normally attempts to run migrations on startup; however, if the database is
          in a read-only state the Docker container will fail to start. Setting the environment variable

      !!! info
          Setting this to `True` is a requirement for all Nautobot core tests as of 1.5.0, and it is set accordingly
          in `nautobot/core/tests/nautobot_config.py`, but defaults to `False` otherwise so as to remain
          backwards-compatible with Apps that also may use the Nautobot test runner in their own test environments,
          but have not yet updated their tests to account for the presence of this test data.

      Because this test data can obviate the need to manually construct complex test data, and the random factor
      can improve test robustness, App developers are encouraged to set this to `True` in their configuration,
      ensure that their development environments include the `factory-boy` Python package as a test dependency,
      and update their tests as needed.

      The time zone Nautobot will use when dealing with dates and times. It is recommended to use UTC time unless you have a specific need to use a local time zone. Please see the [list of available time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

      !!! warning
          Scheduled jobs will default to running in the time zone configured in this setting.
          If you change this setting from the default UTC, it must be set consistently on the Celery Beat server
          and all Nautobot web servers, or else your scheduled jobs may run in the wrong time zone.
