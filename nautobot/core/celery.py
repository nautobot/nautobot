# normally have you set it here, but because of our custom settings bootstrapping

class NautobotKombuJSONEncoder(DjangoJSONEncoder):
    """
    Custom json encoder based on DjangoJSONEncoder that serializes objects that implement
    the `nautobot_serialize()` method via the `__nautobot_type__` interface. This is useful
    in passing special objects to and from Celery tasks.

    This pattern should generally be avoided by passing pointers to persisted objects to the
    Celery tasks and retrieving them from within the task execution. While this is always possible
    for model instances (which covers 99% of use cases), for rare instances where it does not,
    and the actual object must be passed, this pattern allows for encoding and decoding
    of such objects.

    It requires a conforming class to implement the instance method `nautobot_serialize()` which
    returns a json serializable dictionary of the object representation. The class must also implement
    the `nautobot_deserialize()` class method which takes the dictionary representation and returns
    an actual instance of the class.
