# Job Hooks

+++ 1.4.0

A Job Hook is a mechanism for automatically starting a [job](../../additional-features/jobs.md) when an object is changed. Job Hooks are similar to [webhooks](webhook.md) except that an object change event initiates a `JobHookReceiver` job instead of a web request. Job hooks are configured in the web UI under **Jobs > Job Hooks**.

## Configuration

* **Name** - A unique name for the job hook.
* **Content type(s)** - The type or types of Nautobot object that will trigger the job hook.
* **Job** - The [job hook receiver](#job-hook-receivers) that this job hook will run.
* **Enabled** - If unchecked, the job hook will be inactive.
* **Events** - A job hook may trigger on any combination of create, update, and delete events. At least one event type must be selected.

For any Job that is loaded into Nautobot, the Job must be enabled to run. See [Enabling Jobs for Running](../../additional-features/jobs.md#enabling-jobs-for-running) for more details.

## Job Hook Receivers

Job Hooks are only able to initiate a specific type of job called a **Job Hook Receiver**. These are jobs that subclass the `nautobot.extras.jobs.JobHookReceiver` class. Job hook receivers are similar to normal jobs except they are hard coded to accept only an `object_change` [variable](../../additional-features/jobs.md#variables). Job Hook Receivers are hidden from the jobs listing UI by default but otherwise function similarly to other jobs. The `JobHookReceiver` class only implements one method called `receive_job_hook`.

!!! warning
    Requiring approval for execution of Job Hooks by setting the `Meta.approval_required` attribute to `True` on your `JobHookReceiver` subclass is not supported. The value of this attribute will be ignored. Support for requiring approval of Job Hooks will be added in a future release.

!!! important
    To prevent negatively impacting system performance through an infinite loop, a change that was made by a `JobHookReceiver` job will not trigger another `JobHookReceiver` job to run.

### Example Job Hook Receiver

```py
from nautobot.extras.choices import ObjectChangeActionChoices
from nautobot.extras.jobs import JobHookReceiver


class ExampleJobHookReceiver(JobHookReceiver):
    def receive_job_hook(self, change, action, changed_object):
        # return on delete action
        if action == ObjectChangeActionChoices.ACTION_DELETE:
            return

        # log diff output
        snapshots = change.get_snapshots()
        self.log_info(f"DIFF: {snapshots['differences']}")

        # validate changes to serial field
        if "serial" in snapshots["differences"]["added"]:
            old_serial = snapshots["differences"]["removed"]["serial"]
            new_serial = snapshots["differences"]["added"]["serial"]
            self.log_info(f"{changed_object} serial has been changed from {old_serial} to {new_serial}")

            # Check the new serial is valid and revert if necessary
            if not self.validate_serial(new_serial):
                changed_object.serial = old_serial
                changed_object.save()
                self.log_info(f"{changed_object} serial {new_serial} was not valid. Reverted to {old_serial}")

            self.log_success(message=f"Serial validation completed for {changed_object}")

    def validate_serial(self, serial):
        # add business logic to validate serial
        return False
```

### The `receive_job_hook()` Method

All `JobHookReceiver` subclasses must implement a `receive_job_hook()` method. This method accepts three arguments:

1. `change` - An instance of `nautobot.extras.models.ObjectChange`
2. `action` - A string with the action performed on the changed object ("create", "update" or "delete")
3. `changed_object` - An instance of the object that was changed, or `None` if the object has been deleted
