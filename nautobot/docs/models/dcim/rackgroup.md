# Rack Groups

Racks can be organized into groups, which can be nested into themselves similar to regions. As with sites, how you choose to designate rack groups will depend on the nature of your organization.

Each rack group must be assigned to a parent site (and optionally also a more specific location within that site). Rack groups may optionally be nested within one another to model a multi-level hierarchy.

The name and facility ID of each rack within a group must be unique. (Racks not assigned to the same rack group may have identical names and/or facility IDs.)
