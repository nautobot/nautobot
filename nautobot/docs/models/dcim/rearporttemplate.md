# Rear Port Templates

A template for a rear-facing pass-through port that will be created on all instantiations of the parent device type. Each rear port may have a physical type and one or more front port templates assigned to it. The number of positions associated with a rear port determines how many front ports can be assigned to it (the maximum is 1024).
