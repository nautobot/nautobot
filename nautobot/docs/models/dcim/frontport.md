# Front Ports

Front ports are pass-through ports used to represent physical cable connections that comprise part of a longer path. For example, the ports on the front face of a UTP patch panel would be modeled in Nautobot as front ports. Each port is assigned a physical type, and must be mapped to a specific rear port on the same device. A single rear port may be mapped to multiple rear ports, using numeric positions to annotate the specific alignment of each.
