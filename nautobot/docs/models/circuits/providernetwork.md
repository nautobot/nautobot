# Provider Network

+++ 1.3.0

A provider network represents an abstract portion of network topology, just like in a topology diagram. For example, a provider network may be used to represent a provider's MPLS network.

Each provider network must be assigned to a provider. A circuit may terminate to either a provider network or to a site.
