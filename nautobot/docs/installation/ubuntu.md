# Installing Nautobot Dependencies on Ubuntu

This installation guide assumes that you are running Ubuntu version 20.04 on your system.

## Install System Packages

Install the prerequisite system libraries and utilities.

This will install:

- Git
- Python 3
- Pip
- Redis server and client

```no-highlight
$ sudo apt update -y
$ sudo apt install -y git python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev redis-server
```

## Database Setup

In this step you'll set up your database server, create a database and database user for use by Nautobot, and verify your connection to the database.

You must select either MySQL or PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is used by default with Nautobot, so if you just want to get started or don't have a preference, please stick with PostgreSQL.

Please follow the steps for your selected database backend below.

### PostgreSQL Setup

#### Install PostgreSQL

This will install the PostgreSQL database server and client.

```no-highlight
$ sudo apt install -y postgresql
```

#### Create a Database

At a minimum, we need to create a database for Nautobot and assign it a username and password for authentication. This
is done with the following commands.

!!! danger
    **Do not use the password from the example.** Choose a strong, random password to ensure secure database
    authentication for your Nautobot installation.

```no-highlight
$ sudo -u postgres psql
psql (12.5 (Ubuntu 12.5-0ubuntu0.20.04.1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE nautobot;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# CREATE USER nautobot WITH PASSWORD 'insecure_password';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nautobot TO nautobot;
GRANT
postgres=# \q
```

#### Verify Service Status

You can verify that authentication works issuing the following command and providing the configured password. (Replace `localhost` with your database server if using a remote database.)

If successful, you will enter a `nautobot` prompt. Type `\conninfo` to confirm your connection, or type `\q` to exit.

```no-highlight
$ psql --username nautobot --password --host localhost nautobot
Password for user nautobot:
psql (12.5 (Ubuntu 12.5-0ubuntu0.20.04.1))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

nautobot=> \conninfo
You are connected to database "nautobot" as user "nautobot" on host "localhost" (address "127.0.0.1") at port "5432".
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
nautobot=> \q
```

### MySQL Setup

#### Install MySQL

This will install the MySQL database server and client. Additionally, MySQL requires that the MySQL development libraries are installed so that we may compile the Python `mysqlclient` library during the Nautobot installation steps.

```no-highlight
sudo apt install -y libmysqlclient-dev mysql-server
```

#### Create a Database

At a minimum, we need to create a database for Nautobot and assign it a username and password for authentication. This is done with the following commands.

!!! note
    Replace `localhost` below with your database server if using a remote database.

!!! danger
    **Do not use the password from the example.** Choose a strong, random password to ensure secure database authentication for your Nautobot installation.

```no-highlight
$ sudo -u root mysql

mysql> GRANT ALL ON nautobot.* TO 'nautobot'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> \q
Bye
```

#### Verify Service Status

You can verify that authentication works issuing the following command and providing the configured password.

If successful, you will enter a `mysql>` prompt. Type `status` to confirm your connection, or type `\q` to exit.

!!! note
    Replace `localhost` below with your database server if using a remote database.

```no-highlight
$ mysql --user nautobot --password --host localhost nautobot
Enter password:

## Redis Setup

Since Redis was already installed, let's just verify that it's working using `redis-cli`:

```
$ redis-cli ping
PONG
```

## Deploy Nautobot

Now that Nautobot dependencies are installed and configured, you're ready to [Install Nautobot](../nautobot)!
