# Tenant Groups

Tenants can be organized by custom groups. For instance, you might create one group called "Customers" and one called "Departments." The assignment of a tenant to a group is optional.

Tenant groups may be nested recursively to achieve a multi-level hierarchy. For example, you might have a group called "Customers" containing subgroups of individual tenants grouped by product or account team.
