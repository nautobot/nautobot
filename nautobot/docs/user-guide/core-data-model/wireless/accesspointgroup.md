# Access Point Groups

AccessPointGroup represents a set of wireless devices sharing the same wireless configuration. A group broadcasts the same [Wireless Networks](wirelessnetwork.md) with the same [Radio Profiles](radioprofile.md).

The AccessPointGroup is enforced, even if you intend to only have a single access point device. This is done in the interest of simplicity, and should be explicitly documented.

Fields on the Access Point Group include:

- Name
- [Devices](../dcim/device.md)
- [Wireless Networks](wirelessnetwork.md)
- [Radio Profiles](radioprofile.md)
- [Controller](../dcim/controller.md)
