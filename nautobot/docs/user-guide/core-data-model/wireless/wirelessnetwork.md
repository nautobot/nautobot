## Wireless Networks VLAN field

When adding an Access Point Group to a Wireless Network, there is the ability to add a VLAN. This VLAN is stored on a table that references the Wireless Network and the Access Point Group this is the [AccessPointGroupWirelessNetworkAssignment](accesspointgroupwirelessnetworkassignment.md). This allows the ability to use specific VLAN for each Wireless Network/Access Point Group relationship.
