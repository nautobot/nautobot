# Cloud Accounts

Cloud accounts provide a way to track account details for public and private cloud [providers](../dcim/manufacturer.md) (AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean and OpenStack etc) in Nautobot. Each cloud account has to have a unique name and an account number and you may optionally assign a secrets group to it.
