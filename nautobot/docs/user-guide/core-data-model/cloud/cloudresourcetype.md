# Cloud Resource Types

The Cloud Resource Type model in Nautobot offers a way to describe different type definitions and deployment options for [cloud networks](./cloudnetwork.md) and [cloud services](./cloudservice.md). A cloud resource type instance can include a config schema that is applied to validate the configuration of specific [cloud networks](./cloudnetwork.md) and [cloud services](./cloudservice.md) using this type. Common cloud resource types could be "AWS Application Load Balancer", "Azure Application Gateway", "Google Cloud HTTP(s)", etc.

Each cloud resource type must have a unique name and must be assigned to a public or private cloud [provider](../dcim/manufacturer.md) (AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean, OpenStack, etc.). You also must populate the `content_types` attribute to designate which content types (Cloud Service or Cloud Network) the cloud resource type instance applies to.
