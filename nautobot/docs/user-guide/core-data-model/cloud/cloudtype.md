# Cloud Types

Cloud type in Nautobot offers a way to track different type definitions and deployment options for [cloud services](./cloudservice.md). Each cloud type must have a unique name and must be assigned to a public and private cloud [provider](../dcim/manufacturer.md) (AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean and OpenStack etc). The user can also use the optional `content_types` attribute to designate which content types that the cloud type instance applies to.
