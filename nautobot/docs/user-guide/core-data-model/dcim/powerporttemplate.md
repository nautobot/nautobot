# Power Port Templates

A template for a power port that will be created on all instantiations of the parent device type or module type. Each power port can be assigned a physical type, as well as a maximum and allocated draw in watts.

    This model has been updated to support being installed in [Modules](module.md) through the [ModuleType](moduletype.md) model. As a result, there are now two fields for assignment to a DeviceType or ModuleType. One of the `device_type` or `module_type` fields must be populated but not both. If a `module_type` is supplied, the `device_type` field must be null, and similarly the `module_type` field must be null if a `device_type` is supplied.
