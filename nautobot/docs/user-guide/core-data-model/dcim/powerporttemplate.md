# Power Port Templates

A template for a power port that will be created on all instantiations of the parent device type. Each power port can be assigned a physical type, as well as a maximum and allocated draw in watts.

    The fields `created` and `last_updated` were added to all device component template models. If you upgraded from Nautobot 1.4.4 or earlier, the values for these fields will default to `None` (null).
