# Console Ports

A console port provides connectivity to the physical console of a device. These are typically used for temporary access by someone who is physically near the device, or for remote out-of-band access provided via a networked console server. Each console port may be assigned a physical type.

Cables can connect console ports to console server ports or pass-through ports.
