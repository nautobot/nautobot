# Power Outlet Templates

A template for a power outlet that will be created on all instantiations of the parent device type or module type. Each power outlet can be assigned a physical type, and its power source may be mapped to a specific feed leg and power port template. This association will be automatically replicated when the device type is instantiated.

+/- 2.3.0
    This model has been updated to support being installed in [Modules](module.md) through the [ModuleType](moduletype.md) model. As a result, there are now two fields for assignment to a DeviceType or ModuleType. One of the `device_type` or `module_type` fields must be populated but not both. If a `module_type` is supplied, the `device_type` field must be null, and similarly the `module_type` field must be null if a `device_type` is supplied.
