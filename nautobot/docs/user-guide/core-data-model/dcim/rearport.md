# Rear Ports

Like front ports, rear ports are pass-through ports which represent the continuation of a path from one cable to the next. Each rear port is defined with its physical type and a number of positions: Rear ports with more than one position can be mapped to multiple front ports. This can be useful for modeling instances where multiple paths share a common cable (for example, six discrete two-strand fiber connections sharing a 12-strand MPO cable).

!!! note
    Front and rear ports need not necessarily reside on the actual front or rear device face. This terminology is used primarily to distinguish between the two components in a pass-through port pairing.

+++ 1.4.5
    The fields `created` and `last_updated` were added to all device component models. If you upgraded from Nautobot 1.4.4 or earlier, the values for these fields will default to `None` (null).

+/- 2.3.0
    This model has been updated to support being installed in [Modules](module.md). As a result, there are now two fields for assignment to a Device or Module. One of the `device` or `module` fields must be populated but not both. If a `module` is supplied, the `device` field must be null, and similarly the `module` field must be null if a `device` is supplied.
