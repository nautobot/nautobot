# Module Families

A module family represents a group of related [module types](moduletype.md). A module family can be optionally assigned to a module type and a [module bay](modulebay.md). A module bay assigned to a module family will only accept module types from the same family. This is useful, for example, to ensure that only PSUs are installed in PSU slots. Each module family must have a unique name and may have a description assigned to it.
