# Manufacturers

A manufacturer represents the "maker" of a [device](device.md) or [module](module.md); e.g. Cisco or Dell. Each [device type](devicetype.md) and [module type](moduletype.md) must be assigned to a manufacturer. ([Inventory items](inventoryitem.md) and [platforms](platform.md) may also be associated with manufacturers.) Each manufacturer must have a unique name and may have a description assigned to it.

!!! tip
    Manufacturers are also the recommended way to represent cloud providers that your [cloud accounts](../cloud/cloudaccount.md) and your [cloud resource types](../cloud/cloudresourcetype.md) belong to.
