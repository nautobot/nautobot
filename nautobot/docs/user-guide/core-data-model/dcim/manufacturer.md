# Manufacturers

A manufacturer represents the "make" of a device; e.g. Cisco or Dell. Each device type must be assigned to a manufacturer. (Inventory items and platforms may also be associated with manufacturers.) Each manufacturer must have a unique name and may have a description assigned to it.

!!! tip
    Manufacturers are also the recommended way to represent cloud providers that your [cloud accounts](../cloud/cloudaccount.md) and your [cloud types](../cloud/cloudtype.md) belong to.
