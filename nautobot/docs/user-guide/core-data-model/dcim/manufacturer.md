# Manufacturers

A manufacturer represents the "make" of a device; e.g. Cisco or Dell. Each device type must be assigned to a manufacturer. (Inventory items and platforms may also be associated with manufacturers.) Each manufacturer must have a unique name and may have a description assigned to it.
