# Software Version

+++ 2.2.0
    This model will replace the `SoftwareLCM` model from [Nautobot Device Lifecycle Management](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/device-lifecycle/en/latest/)

Software versions are used to track attributes that may apply to multiple [software images](softwareimagefile.md). A software version must be assigned to a platform and can optionally have a release date, end of support date, documentation url and flags that indicate if the version is a pre-release or a long term support version.
