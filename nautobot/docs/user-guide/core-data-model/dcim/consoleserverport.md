# Console Server Ports

A console server is a device which provides remote access to the local consoles of connected devices. They are typically used to provide remote out-of-band access to network devices. Each console server port may be assigned a physical type.

Cables can connect console server ports to console ports or pass-through ports.

+++ 1.4.5
    The fields `created` and `last_updated` were added to all device component models. If you upgraded from Nautobot 1.4.4 or earlier, the values for these fields will default to `None` (null).

+/- 2.3.0
    This model has been updated to support being installed in [Modules](module.md). As a result, there are now two fields for assignment to a Device or Module. One of the `device` or `module` fields must be populated but not both. If a `module` is supplied, the `device` field must be null, and similarly the `module` field must be null if a `device` is supplied.
