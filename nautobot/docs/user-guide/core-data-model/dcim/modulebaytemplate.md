# Module Bay Templates

+++ 2.3.0

A template for a [ModuleBay](modulebay.md) that will be created on all instantiations of the parent device type or module type. Each module bay must be assigned a `position` unique to the parent.

A module bay template can optionally be assigned a [module family](modulefamily.md) to restrict which types of modules can be installed in the bay. If a module family is specified, only modules of that family can be installed in module bays created from this template.
