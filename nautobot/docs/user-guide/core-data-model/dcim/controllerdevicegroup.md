# Controller Device Groups

A Controller Device Group in Nautobot models the relationship between [controllers](./controller.md) and the [devices](./device.md) they manage. It organizes devices under specific controllers, providing a structured way to represent devices controlled by a central network management system. These systems might include, but are not limited to, software-defined networking (SDN) controllers, wireless controllers, and cloud-based network management platforms.

The relationship between a Controller Device Group, its controllers, and devices is key to managing and visualizing how devices are grouped and controlled. This model allows devices to be categorized into hierarchical groups, making it easier to manage large networks. Each group is directly associated with a Controller, symbolizing the control link between the controller and the devices within the group.

Key Features:

- **Structured Organization:** Facilitates the grouping of devices under specific controllers, simplifying management tasks.
- **Flexible Modeling:** Fits various network management scenarios, including SDN controllers, wireless controllers, and cloud-based services.
- **Enhanced Management:** Improves the representation of device-controller relationships, aiding in more efficient network management operations.
