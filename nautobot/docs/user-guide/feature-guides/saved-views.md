# Saved Views

Below is a user guide on how to create, update, save and use saved views in Nautobot.

## When to use Saved Views

This feature gives users the ability to save multiple list view configurations (table columns, filtering, pagination and sorting) into saved view instances for ease of access during later use and reuse.

## How to use Saved Views

### How to create a new Saved View

Navigate to any saved-view-supported model's list view. (We will use Location List View for the purpose of this guide)

Note that there is a "Saved Views" dropdown button in the group of buttons on the right hand side.

Configure the list view.

Once you are satisfied with the current list view configurations, click on the "Saved Views" dropdown button. There should be an option in the dropdown menu named "Save As New View".

Click the "Save As New View" option, a modal should appear to prompt you to give a name to your new saved view.

We will name this new saved view "Campus Staging Location List View".

Click the "Save" button on the modal and the browser should take you to the new saved view. Note the success banner on top of the page stating "Successfully created new Saved View Campus Staging Location List View".

Click the "Saved Views" dropdown button again and you should see your new saved view's name and a new option "Update Current View" populated in the dropdown menu.

### How to update an existing Saved View

Stay on the same page where we just created the new Saved View and make some modifications to the view.

Note that an asterik appeared next to the title of the view. The asterik is an indicator that this saved view currently has unsaved changes.

Once you have made desired changes, click the "Saved Views" dropdown button and you should see the option "Update Current View".

Click "Update Current View" option and the page should refresh and you should see the success banner on top of the page stating "Successfully updated current view Campus Staging Location List View".

Congratulations, you have successfully updated your saved view!
