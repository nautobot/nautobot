# Request Profiling

Nautobot offers advanced request profiling through [django-silk](https://github.com/jazzband/django-silk). This allows administrators to collect debug information about user activities, which can be used to troubleshoot issues with the system.

## User Setting

Request profiling may be enabled by individual users in their profile within the web interface. This can be found under the "Advanced Settings" section.

Once a user enables request profiling, all subsequent HTTP requests made by that specific user to the system will be logged by django-silk. This setting will persist until the user either logs out or disables the setting in their profile.

## Silk UI

Nautobot administrators with super-user permissions can access the django-silk UI at the `/silk/` URL.

From there, administrators can view details of individual requests, including timing, SQL queries, and cProfile artifacts.

## Configuration

The Nautobot configuration comes out of the box with django-silk set up to support the above functionality. Those settings are described below, but it is not the intention of the Nautobot docs to describe all django-silk settings. Django-silk provides several other parameters that knowledgeable users may also be able to use, depending on the use case.

### ALLOW_REQUEST_PROFILING

Default: `False`

Global setting to allow or deny users from enabling request profiling on their login session.

---

### SILKY_PYTHON_PROFILER

Default: `True`

Enables use of the built-in Python cProfile profiler.

---

### SILKY_PYTHON_PROFILER_BINARY

Default: `True`

Generates a binary `.prof` file for each profiled request, which can be downloaded.

---

### SILKY_PYTHON_PROFILER_EXTENDED_FILE_NAME

Default: `True`

Adds part of the request URL path to the profile file name to make it easier to identify specific requests.

---

### SILKY_INTERCEPT_FUNC

Default: `nautobot.core.settings.silk_request_logging_intercept_logic`

This defines a custom function that filters requests to be profiled. Notably, the default looks for the user session flag described above.

---

### SILKY_AUTHENTICATION

Default: `True`

Users must be authenticated to access the django-silk UI.

---

### SILKY_AUTHORISATION

Default: `True`

Users must have permissions to access the django-silk UI. Used in combination with `SILKY_AUTHENTICATION`.

---

### SILKY_PERMISSIONS

Default: `nautobot.core.settings.silk_user_permissions`

This ensures the users must be a superuser of the system to access the django-silk UI. Used in combination with `SILKY_AUTHENTICATION` and `SILKY_AUTHORISATION`.
