- **Core Data Model**: Read about all the Nautobot [data models](./core-data-model/overview.md) used to store your network data.
- **Platform Functionality**: Dive deep into Nautobot extensibility, such as building automation with [Jobs](./platform-functionality/jobs/index.md), programmatically accessing data through the [REST](./platform-functionality/rest-api/overview.md) and [GraphQL](./platform-functionality/graphql.md) APIs, or using [Git repositories](./platform-functionality/gitrepository.md) as a data source.
