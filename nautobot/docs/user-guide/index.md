# User Guide Overview

Welcome to the Nautobot User Guide! The User Guide is designed to help you setup, use, and operate your Nautobot installation.

There are four main headings within the User Guide:

- **Administration**: Get detailed instructions on [installation](./administration/installation/index.md), [migration](./administration/migration/migrating-from-netbox.md), [configuration](./administration/configuration/index.md), and [upgrading Nautobot](./administration/upgrading/upgrading.md).
- **Feature Guides**: Walk through these guides if you are a [new user to Nautobot](./feature-guides/getting-started/index.md) and wondering how to perform common tasks in the Web UI.
- **Core Data Model**: Read about all the Nautobot [data models](./core-data-model/overview/introduction.md) used to store your network data.
- **Platform Functionality**: Dive deep into Nautobot extensibility, such as building automation with [Jobs](./platform-functionality/jobs/index.md), programmatically accessing data through the [REST](./platform-functionality/rest-api/overview.md) and [GraphQL](./platform-functionality/graphql.md) APIs, or using [Git repositories](./platform-functionality/gitrepository.md) as a data source.
