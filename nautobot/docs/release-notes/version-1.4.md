# Nautobot v1.4

This document describes all new features and changes in Nautobot 1.4.

If you are a user migrating from NetBox to Nautobot, please refer to the ["Migrating from NetBox"](../installation/migrating-from-netbox.md) documentation.

## Release Overview

### Added

#### Custom Field Extended Filtering ([#1498](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1498))

Objects with custom fields now support [filter lookup expressions](../rest-api/filtering.md#lookup-expressions) for filtering by custom field values, such as `cf_date_field__gte=2022-08-11` to select objects whose `date_field` custom field has a date of 2022-08-11 or later.

#### Custom Field Slugs ([#1962](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1962))

Custom fields now have a distinct `slug` field. The custom field `name` attribute should be considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future major release (see also [#824](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/824).) Additionally, the `label` attribute, while currently optional in the database, will become mandatory in that same future release as a consequence. When migrating from an earlier Nautobot release to version 1.4 or later, the `slug` and `label` for all existing custom fields will be automatically populated if not previously defined.

A new version of the `/api/extras/custom-fields/` REST API endpoints has been implemented. By default this endpoint continues to demonstrate the pre-1.4 behavior (`name` required, `slug` and `label` optional; if unspecified, the `slug` and `label` will receive default values based on the provided `name`). A REST API client can request API version 1.4, in which case the updated API will require `slug` and `label` parameters in place of `name`.

Additionally, REST API serialization of custom field data is itself now versioned. For _all_ object endpoints that include custom field data under the `custom_fields` key, REST API versions 1.3 and earlier will continue the previous behavior of indexing the `custom_fields` dictionary by fields' `name` values, but when REST API version 1.4 or later is requested, the `custom_fields` data will be indexed by `slug` instead.

For technical reasons of backwards-compatibility, the database (ORM) and GraphQL interfaces continue to access and store object custom field data exclusively under the `name` key; this will change to use the `slug` in a future major release. Again, watch [#824](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/824) for plans in that regard.

#### Custom Tabs in Object Detail Views ([#1000](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1000))

A plugin may now define extra tabs which will be appended to the object view's list of tabs.

You can refer to the [plugin development guide](../plugins/development.md#adding-extra-tabs) on how to add tabs to existing object detail views.

#### Custom Template (CSS, HTML, JavaScript) on Job Forms ([#1865](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1865))

Jobs can now specify a `template_name` property and provide a custom template with additional JavaScript and CSS to help with user input on the Job submission form.

You can refer to the [Job class metadata attribute documentation](../additional-features/jobs.md#template_name) on how to build and define this template.

#### Dynamic Groups Support Additional Models ([#2200](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2200))

Cluster, IP Address, Prefix, and Rack models can now be filtered on in Dynamic Groups and can also support nested or groups of Dynamic Groups. Some fields have been excluded from filtering until a sensible widget can be provided.

#### Dark Mode UI ([#729](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/729))

Nautobot's UI now supports dark mode, both explicitly and via browser preference selection.

The "Theme" link in the footer provides a modal popup to select the preferred theme. This preference is saved per browser via `localStorage`.

#### Improved Filter Coverage for DCIM and Virtualization Models

- DCIM: [#1729](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1729)
- Virtualization: [#1735](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1735)

The DCIM, Virtualization FilterSets have been updated with over 150 new filters, including hybrid filters that support filtering on both `pk` and `slug` (or `pk` and `name` where `slug` is not available). A new filter class `NaturalKeyOrPKMultipleChoiceFilter` was added to `nautobot.utilities.filters` to support filtering on multiple fields of a related object.

Please see the documentation on [best practices for mapping model fields to filters](../development/best-practices.md#mapping-model-fields-to-filters) for more information.

#### Job Hooks ([#1878](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1878))

Jobs can now be configured to run automatically when a change event occurs on a Nautobot object. Job hooks associate jobs to content types and actions to run jobs when a create, update or delete action occurs on the selected content type. A new job base class `JobHookReceiver` was introduced that jobs must subclass to be associated with a job hook.

Please see the documentation on [Job Hooks](../models/extras/jobhook.md) for more information.

#### Job Re-Runs ([#1875](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1875))

JobResult records now save the arguments with which the Job was called, allowing for easy re-execution of the Job with the same arguments as before. A "re-run" button has been added to the JobResult list view and detail view.

#### Location Data Model ([#1052](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1052))

To locate network information more precisely than a Site defines, you can now define a hierarchy of Location Types (for example, `Building` ← `Floor` ← `Room`) and then create Locations corresponding to these types within each Site. Data objects such as devices, prefixes, VLAN groups, etc. can thus be mapped or assigned to Location representing a specific building, wing, floor, room, etc. as appropriate to your needs.

!!! info
    At present, Locations fill the conceptual space between the more abstract Region and Site models and the more concrete Rack Group model. In a future Nautobot release, some or all of these other models may be collapsed into Locations. That is to say, in the future you might not deal with Regions and Sites as distinct models, but instead your Location Type hierarchy might include these higher-level categories, becoming something like Country ← City ← Site ← Building ← Floor ← Room.

#### Parent Interfaces and Bridge Interfaces ([#1455](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1455))

Interface and VMInterface models now have `parent_interface` and `bridge` keys. An interface of type `Virtual` can now associate to a parent physical interface on the same device, virtual chassis, or virtual machine, and an interface of any type can specify another interface as its associated bridge interface. (A new `Bridge` interface type has also been added, but the `bridge` interface property is not restricted to interfaces of this type.)

#### Rackview UI - Add Option to Truncate Device Name ([#1119](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1119))

Users can now toggle device full name and truncated name in the rack elevation view. The truncating function is customizable in `nautobot_config.py` via defining `UI_RACK_VIEW_TRUNCATE_FUNCTION`. Default behavior is to split on `.` and return the first item in the list.

"Save SVG" link presents the same view as what is currently displayed on screen

Current preferred toggle state is preserved across tabs (requires refresh) and persists in-browser until local storage is cleared. This presents a consistent behavior when browsing between multiple racks.

#### REST API Enhancements ([#1463](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1463))

- For all models that support Relationships, their corresponding list and detail REST API endpoints now include the option to include data on their associated Relationships and related objects by specifying `include=relationships` as a query parameter.
- Relationship associations on a model can be edited by a PATCH to the appropriate nested value, such as `"relationships" -> <relationship-slug> -> "source"` or `"relationships" -> <relationship-slug> -> "destination"`.
- For implementers of REST API serializers (core and/or plugins), a new `nautobot.extras.api.serializers.NautobotModelSerializer` base class has been added. Using this class guarantees support for relationships, custom fields, and computed fields on the serializer, and provides for a streamlined developer experience.

#### Status Field on Interface, VMInterface Models ([#984](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/984))

Interface and VMInterface models now support a status. Default statuses that are available to be set are: Active, Planned, Maintenance, Failed, and Decommissioned. During migration all existing interfaces will be set to the status of "Active".

A new version of the `/dcim/interfaces/*` REST API endpoints have been implemented. By default this endpoint continues to demonstrate the pre-1.4 behavior unless the REST API client explicitly requests API version=1.4. If you continue to use the pre-1.4 API endpoints, status is defaulted to "Active".

Visit the documentation on [REST API versioning](../rest-api/overview.md#versioning) for more information on using the versioned APIs.

#### NautobotUIViewSet ([#1812](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1812))

New in Nautobot 1.4 is the debut of `NautobotUIViewSet`: A powerful plugin development tool that can save plugin developer hundreds of lines of code compared to using legacy `generic.views`. Using it to gain access to default functionalities previous provided by `generic.views` such as `create()`, `bulk_create()`, `update()`, `partial_update()`, `bulk_update()`, `destroy()`, `bulk_destroy()`, `retrieve()` and `list()` actions.

Note that this ViewSet is catered specifically to the UI, not the API.

Concrete examples on how to use `NautobotUIViewSet` resides in `nautobot.circuits.views`.

Please visit the [plugin development guide on `NautobotViewSet`](../plugins/development.md#nautobotuiviewset) for more information.

#### Notes ([#767](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/767))

Primary and Organizational models now support notes. A notes tab has been added to the Object Detail view for all models that inherit the Primary or Organizational base abstract models.

!!! warning
    Any plugin that inherits from one of these two models and uses the `ViewTestCases.PrimaryObjectViewTestCase` or `ViewTestCases.OrganizationalObjectViewTestCase` for their test will need to add the `NotesObjectView` to the objects URLs.

Notes can also be used via the REST API at endpoint `/api/extras/notes/` or per object detail endpoint at the object's nested `/notes/` endpoint.

!!! info
    For implementers of REST API views (core and/or plugins), a new `nautobot.extras.api.views.NautobotModelViewSet` base class has been added. Use of this class ensures that all features from `PrimaryModel` or `OrganizationalModel` are accessible through the API. This includes custom fields and notes.

Please see the on [plugin development guide on Notes](../plugins/development.md#note-url-endpoint) for more details.

### Changed

#### Dynamic Groups of Dynamic Groups ([#1614](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1614))

Dynamic Groups may now be nested in parent/child relationships. The Dynamic Group edit view now has a "Child Groups" tab that allows one to make other Dynamic Groups of the same content type children of the parent group. Any filters provided by the child groups are used to filter the members from the parent group using one of three operators: "Restrict (AND)", "Include (OR)", or "Exclude (NOT)". This allows for logical parenthetical grouping of nested groups by the operator you choose for that child group association to the parent.

!!! warning
    The default behavior of Dynamic Groups with an empty filter (`{}`) has been inverted to include all objects matching the content type by default instead of matching no objects. This was necessary to implement the progressive layering of child filters similarly to how we use filters to reduce desired objects from basic list view filters.

Please see the greatly-expanded documentation on [Dynamic Groups](../models/extras/dynamicgroup.md) for more information.

#### Renamed Mixin Classes ([#2135](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2135))

A number of mixin classes have been renamed for improved self-consistency and clarity of usage. The former names of these mixins are still available for now as aliases, but inheriting from these mixins will raise a `DeprecationWarning`, and these aliases will be removed in a future major release.

| Former Name                 | New Name                            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `AddRemoveTagsForm`         | `TagsBulkEditFormMixin`             |
| `CustomFieldBulkCreateForm` | `CustomFieldModelBulkEditFormMixin` |
| `CustomFieldBulkEditForm`   | `CustomFieldModelBulkEditFormMixin` |
| `CustomFieldFilterForm`     | `CustomFieldModelFilterFormMixin`   |
| `CustomFieldModelForm`      | `CustomFieldModelFormMixin`         |
| `RelationshipModelForm`     | `RelationshipModelFormMixin`        |
| `StatusBulkEditFormMixin`   | `StatusModelBulkEditFormMixin`      |
| `StatusFilterFormMixin`     | `StatusModelFilterFormMixin`        |

#### Strict Filter Validation by Default ([#1736](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1736))

Filtering of object lists in the UI and in the REST API will now report an error if an unknown or unrecognized filter parameter is specified. _This is a behavior change from previous Nautobot releases, in which unknown filter parameters would be silently discarded and ignored._

A new configuration setting, [`STRICT_FILTERING`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#strict_filtering) has been added. It defaults to `True`, enabling strict validation of filter parameters, but can be set to `False` to disable this validation.

!!! warning
    Setting [`STRICT_FILTERING`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#strict_filtering) to `False` can result in unexpected filtering results in the case of user error, for example a request to `/api/dcim/devices/?has_primry_ip=false` (note the typo `primry`) will result in a list of all devices, rather than the intended list of only devices that lack a primary IP address. In the case of Jobs or external automation making use of such a filter, this could have wide-ranging consequences.

#### Moved Registry Template Context ([#1945](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1945))

The `settings_and_registry` default context processor was changed to purely `settings` - the (large) Nautobot application registry dictionary is no longer provided as part of the render context for all templates by default. Added a new `registry` template tag that can be invoked by specific templates to provide this variable where needed.

## v1.4.0a2 (2022-07-11)

!!! attention
    The  `next` and `develop` branches introduced conflicting migration numbers during the release cycle. This necessitates reordering the migration in `next`. If you installed `v1.4.0a1`, you will need to roll back a migration before upgrading/installing `v1.4.0a2` and newer. If you have not installed `v1.4.0a` this will not be an issue.

    Before upgrading, run: `nautobot-server migrate extras 0033_add__optimized_indexing`. This will revert the reordered migration `0034_configcontextschema__remove_name_unique__create_constraint_unique_name_owner`, which is now number `0035`.

    Perform the Nautobot upgrade as usual and proceed with post-installation migration.

    No data loss is expected as the reordered migration only modified indexing on existing fields.
