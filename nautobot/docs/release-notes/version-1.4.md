# Nautobot v1.4

This document describes all new features and changes in Nautobot 1.4.

If you are a user migrating from NetBox to Nautobot, please refer to the ["Migrating from NetBox"](../installation/migrating-from-netbox.md) documentation.

## Release Overview

### Added

#### Dark Mode UI ([#729](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/729))

Nautobot's UI now supports dark mode, both explicitly and via browser preference selection.

The "Theme" link in the footer provides a modal popup to select the preferred theme. This preference is saved per browser via `localStorage`.

#### Parent Interfaces and Bridge Interfaces ([#1455](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1455))

Interface and VMInterface models now have `parent_interface` and `bridge` keys. An interface of type `Virtual` can now associate to a parent physical interface on the same device, virtual chassis, or virtual machine, and an interface of any type can specify another interface as its associated bridge interface. (A new `Bridge` interface type has also been added, but the `bridge` interface property is not restricted to interfaces of this type.)

#### Rackview UI - Add Option to Truncate Device Name ([#1119](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1119))

Users can now toggle device full name and truncated name in the rack elevation view. The truncating function is customizable in `nautobot_config.py` via defining `UI_RACK_VIEW_TRUNCATE_FUNCTION`. Default behavior is to split on `.` and return the first item in the list.

"Save SVG" link presents the same view as what is currently displayed on screen

Current preferred toggle state is preserved across tabs (requires refresh) and persists in-browser until local storage is cleared. This presents a consistent behavior when browsing between multiple racks.

#### Status Field on Interface, VMInterface Models ([#984](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/984))

Interface and VMInterface models now support a status. Default statuses that are available to be set are: Active, Planned, Maintenance, Failed, and Decommissioned. During migration all existing interfaces will be set to the status of "Active".

A new version of the `/dcim/interfaces/*` REST API endpoints have been implemented. By default this endpoint continues to demonstrate the pre-1.4 behavior unless the REST API client explicitly requests API version=1.4. If you continue to use the pre-1.4 API endpoints, status is defaulted to "Active".

Visit the documentation on [REST API versioning](../rest-api/overview/#versioning) for more information on using the versioned APIs.

#### Object Detail Tabs

A plugin may now define extra tabs which will be appended to the object view's list of tabs ([#1000](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1000)).

#### Improved Filter Coverage for DCIM models ([#1729](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1729))

The DCIM FilterSets have been updated with 103 new filters, including hybrid filters that support filtering on both `pk` and `slug`. A new filter `SlugOrPKMultipleChoiceFilter` was added to `nautobot.utilities.filters` to support filtering on foreign-key related fields that relate to models with `slug` fields. See the [Best Practices](../development/best-practices/#mapping-model-fields-to-filters) documentation for more information.

### Changed

#### Strict Filter Validation by Default ([#1736](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1736))

Filtering of object lists in the UI and in the REST API will now report an error if an unknown or unrecognized filter parameter is specified. _This is a behavior change from previous Nautobot releases, in which unknown filter parameters would be silently discarded and ignored._

A new configuration setting, [`STRICT_FILTERING`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#strict_filtering) has been added. It defaults to `True`, enabling strict validation of filter parameters, but can be set to `False` to disable this validation.

!!! warning
    Setting `STRICT_FILTERING` to `False` can result in unexpected filtering results in the case of user error, for example a request to `/api/dcim/devices/?has_primry_ip=false` (note the typo `primry`) will result in a list of all devices, rather than the intended list of only devices that lack a primary IP address. In the case of Jobs or external automation making use of such a filter, this could have wide-ranging consequences.
