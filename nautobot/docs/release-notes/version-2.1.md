# Nautobot v2.1

This document describes all new features and changes in Nautobot 2.1.

## Release Overview

### Added

#### Django Admin Log Entries ([#4646](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4646))

Django Admin Log Entries record administrative changes made under the "Admin" section of the user interface. Changes (add/delete/update) to Objects like Users, Group, Object Permissions, etc. in the "Admin" user interface are now displayed as "Log Entries" under the "Administration" section of the Admin UI.

!!! info
    Django Admin Log Entries are automatically created when adminstrative changes happen and have always existed natively in Django Admin. This feature is simply providung a read-only UI view for admin/privileged users to access them with more ease.

See [Administrative Change-logging](../user-guide/platform-functionality/change-logging.md#administrative-changes) for more details.

#### External Integration Model ([#4694](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4694))

A new [`ExternalIntegration` model](../user-guide/platform-functionality/externalintegration.md) has been added which provides a centralized store for data such as URLs and credentials that are used to access systems external to Nautobot. This information can then be used by jobs or apps to perform actions such as creating DNS records or updating configuration management tickets.

#### Home Page Panels Can Be Customized ([#2149](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2149))

The panels displayed on the Nautobot home page have been modified to enable a more personalized user experience. Individual panels can now be collapsed, hiding the contents from view. Additionally, panels can be reordered by dragging and dropping the panels to the desired order.

#### Job File Outputs ([#3352](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3352), [#4820](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4820))

The `Job` base class now includes a [`create_file(filename, content)`](../development/jobs/index.md#file-output) method which can be called by a Job to create a persistent file with the provided content when run. This file will be linked from the Job Result detail view for subsequent downloading by users, and can also be downloaded via the REST API (`/api/extras/file-proxies/<id>/download/`) as desired.

The size of files Jobs can create via this method are constrained by the [`JOB_CREATE_FILE_MAX_SIZE`](../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#job_create_file_max_size) settings variable.

!!! info
    The specific storage backend used to retain such files is controlled by the [`JOB_FILE_IO_STORAGE`](../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#job_file_io_storage) settings variable. The default value of this setting uses the Nautobot database to store output files, which should work in all deployments but is generally not optimal and better alternatives may exist in your specific deployment. Refer to the documentation link above for more details.

!!! tip
    Users must have permission to `view` the `extras > file proxy` object type in order to list and download files from the REST API.

#### Job JSONVar inputs ([#4926](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4926))

Provides the ability to have native JSON data inputs for Jobs, this is provided by a multi-line text input on the Job form and the provided JSON data is serialized prior to passing to the `run()` method of the Job.

#### UI/API `isnull` Filter on Nullable Fields ([#1905](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1905))

Models with nullable fields (i.e. model fields with `null=True`) can now be filtered in the UI and the API with `<field>__isnull=true/false` filters. These filters are automatically added to all appropriate fields.

!!! note
    Model fields that have the value `""` (i.e. blank) will not match with `__isnull=True`. Instead, they will match with `__isnull=False`.

### Changed

#### Data Exports as a System Job ([#4745](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4745))

The data export functionality in all object list views (allowing export of all or a filtered subset of objects to CSV, YAML, and/or as defined by an `ExportTemplate`) has been changed from a synchronous operation to an asynchronous background task, leveraging the new `ExportObjectList` system Job. As a result, exports of thousands of objects in a single operation will no longer fail due to browser timeout.

!!! tip
    Users now must have the `run` action permission for `extras > job` (specifically the `nautobot.core.jobs.ExportObjectList` Job) in order to export objects, in addition to the normal `view` permissions for the objects being exported.

#### Nautobot UI Reskin ([#4677](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4677), [#4765](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4765))

The Nautobot UI has been updated with a customized theme, giving it a brand new look. In addition, Nautobot's navigation bar has been moved from the top to the left.

### Removed

#### Drop Support for Legacy PostgreSQL Versions ([#4757](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4757))

Support for versions of PostgreSQL prior to 12.0 has been removed as these versions are no longer maintained and contain bugs that prevent migrations from running in certain scenarios. The `nautobot-server migrate` or `nautobot-server post_upgrade` commands will now abort when detecting an unsupported PostgreSQL version.

#### Remove `HIDE_RESTRICTED_UI` Toggle ([#4787](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4787))

Support for `HIDE_RESTRICTED_UI` has been removed. UI elements requiring specific permissions will now always be hidden from users lacking those permissions. Additionally, users not logged in will now be automatically redirected to the login page.
