# Nautobot v1.6

This document describes all new features and changes in Nautobot 1.6.

## Release Overview

### Added

#### Custom Field "Markdown" Type ([#4006](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4006))

A new Custom Field type, "Markdown", has been added. Custom fields of this type can store Markdown-formatted text which will be rendered in the web UI.

#### Caching of Dynamic Groups and Content Types ([#4092](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4092))

APIs have been added to allow for caching of the results of looking up an object's content-type or Dynamic Group memberships, as well as for looking up the members of a Dynamic Group itself. These caches are disabled by default but can be enabled by configuring the [`DYNAMIC_GROUPS_MEMBER_CACHE_TIMEOUT`](../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#dynamic_groups_member_cache_timeout) and [`CONTENT_TYPE_CACHE_TIMEOUT`](../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#content_type_cache_timeout) settings respectively. Apps (plugins) that make use of dynamic groups should review the [documentation for the APIs](../user-guide/platform-functionality/dynamicgroup.md/#membership-and-caching) to determine how and when to make use of the cache for improved performance.

#### Interface Redundancy Group ([#2825](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2825))

Interface Redundancy Group model and related views have been added to allow logical grouping of multiple interfaces under a specific interface redundancy protocol (HSRP, VRRP, CARP, and etc).

#### Installation Metrics ([#4047](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4047))

A new setting, [`INSTALLATION_METRICS_ENABLED`](../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#installation_metrics_enabled), has been added to allow Nautobot to send anonymous installation metrics to the Nautobot maintainers. This setting is `True` by default but can be changed in `nautobot_config.py` or the `NAUTOBOT_INSTALLATION_METRICS_ENABLED` environment variable.

If the [`INSTALLATION_METRICS_ENABLED`](../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#installation_metrics_enabled) setting is `True`, running the [`post_upgrade`](../user-guide/administration/tools/nautobot-server.md#post_upgrade) or [`send_installation_metrics`](../user-guide/administration/tools/nautobot-server.md#send_installation_metrics) management commands will send a list of all installed [apps](../development/apps/index.md) and their versions, as well as the currently installed Nautobot and Python versions, to the Nautobot maintainers. A randomized UUID will be generated and saved in the [`DEPLOYMENT_ID`](../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#deployment_id) setting to anonymously and uniquely identify each installation. The plugin names will be one-way hashed with SHA256 to further anonymize the data sent. This enables tracking the installation metrics of publicly released apps without disclosing the names of any private apps.

The following is an example of the data that is sent:

```py
{
    "deployment_id": "1de3dacf-f046-4a98-8d4a-17419080db79",
    "nautobot_version": "1.6.0b1",
    "python_version": "3.10.12",
    "installed_apps": {
        # "example_plugin" hashed by sha256
        "3ffee4622af3aad6f78257e3ae12da99ca21d71d099f67f4a2e19e464453bee7": "1.0.0"
    },
    "debug": true
}
```

#### `Platform.network_driver` and related fields ([4136](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4136))

The [Platform](../user-guide/core-data-model/dcim/platform.md) model has been enhanced to include a `network_driver` database field and a `network_driver_mappings` derived property based on the [`netutils`](https://netutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. For example, if you set a Platform to have a `network_driver` value of `"cisco_ios"`, the `platform.network_driver_mappings` property will return a dictionary containing `ansible`, `hier_config`, `napalm`, `netmiko`, `ntc_templates`, `pyats`, `pyntc`, and `scrapli` keys corresponding to this entry. These properties can be referenced via the REST API and GraphQL to assist in developing and maintaining Apps, Jobs, or third-party code that interact with devices by using any of these libraries.

If the default derivations provided by `netutils` are not suitable for your purposes, you can extend or override them by configuring the [`NETWORK_DRIVERS`](../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#network_drivers) system setting.

#### Python 3.11 Support ([#3561](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3561))

Nautobot 1.6.0 formally adds support for installation and operation under Python 3.11.

### Changed

#### Additional `HIDE_RESTRICTED_UI` Effects for Unauthenticated Users ([#3646](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3646))

When `HIDE_RESTRICTED_UI` is enabled, unauthenticated users are no longer able to view the OpenAPI (Swagger) UI, the GraphiQL UI, or any configured top/bottom banners. Additionally, the page footer on the login page will not display the Nautobot server hostname in this case.

#### Increased `Device.asset_tag` maximum length ([#3693](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3693))

The maximum length of the `Device.asset_tag` field has been increased from 50 to 100 characters.

#### Changed Default Python Version for Docker Images ([#4029](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4029))

The default Python version for Nautobot Docker images has been changed from 3.7 to 3.11.

### Removed

#### Removed Python 3.7 Support ([#3561](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3561))

As Python 3.7 has reached end-of-life, Nautobot 1.6 and later do not support installation or operation under Python 3.7.
