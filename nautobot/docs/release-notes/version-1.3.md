# Nautobot v1.3

This document describes all new features and changes in Nautobot 1.3.

If you are a user migrating from NetBox to Nautobot, please refer to the ["Migrating from NetBox"](../installation/migrating-from-netbox.md) documentation.

## Release Overview

### Added

#### Dynamic Group Model ([#896](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/896))

A new data model for representing [dynamic groups](../models/extras/dynamicgroup.md) of objects has been implemented. Dynamic groups can be used to organize objects together by matching criteria such as their site location or region, for example, and are dynamically updated whenever new matching objects are created, or existing objects are updated.

For the initial release only dynamic groups of `Device` and `VirtualMachine` objects are supported. 

!!! note
  For this first 1.3 beta release, this feature is not yet documented. Dynamic Groups be found by navigating to **Organization** > **Dynamic Groups** in the web interface.

#### GraphQL Pagination ([#1109](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1109))

GraphQL list queries can now be paginated by specifying the filter parameters `limit` and `offset`. Refer to the [user guide](../user-guides/graphql.md#filtering-queries) for examples.

#### Job Database Model ([#1001](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1001))

Installed Jobs are now represented by a data model in the Nautobot database. This allows for new functionality including:

- The Jobs listing UI view can now be filtered and searched like most other Nautobot table/list views.
- Job attributes (name, description, approval requirements, etc.) can now be managed via the Nautobot UI by an administrator or user with appropriate permissions to customize or override the attributes defined in the Job source code.
- Jobs can now be identified by a `slug` as well as by their `class_path`.
- A new set of REST API endpoints have been added at `api/extras/job-models`. The existing `api/extras/jobs` REST API continues to work but should be considered as deprecated.

!!! warning
    The new Jobs REST API endpoint URL is likely to change before the final release of Nautobot 1.3.

- As a minor security measure, newly installed Jobs default to `enabled = False`, preventing them from being run until an administrator or user with appropriate permissions updates them to be enabled for running.

!!! note
    As a convenience measure, when initially upgrading to Nautobot 1.3.x, any existing Jobs that have been run or scheduled previously (i.e., have at least one associated JobResult and/or ScheduledJob record) will instead default to `enabled = True` so that they may continue to be run without requiring changes.

For more details please refer to the [Jobs feature documentation](../additional-features/jobs.md) as well as the [Job data model documentation](../models/extras/job.md).

#### JSON Type for Custom Fields

Custom fields can now have a type of "json". Fields of this type can be used to store arbitrary JSON data.

#### Provider Network Model ([#724](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/724))

A [data model](../models/circuits/providernetwork.md) has been added to support representing the termination of a circuit to an external provider's network.

#### Python 3.10 Support ([#1255](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/1255))

Python 3.10 is officially supported by Nautobot now, and we are building and publishing Docker images with Python 3.10 now.

### Changed

#### Update Jinja2 to 3.x ([#1474](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/1474))

We've updated the Jinja2 dependency from version 2.11 to version 3.0.3. This may affect the syntax of any `nautobot.extras.models.ComputedField` objects in your database... Specifically, the `template` attribute, which is parsed as a Jinja2 template. Please refer to [Jinja2 3.0.x's release notes](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/changes/) to check if any changes might be required in your computed fields' templates.

#### Docker Images Now Default to Python 3.7 ([#1252](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/1252))

As Python 3.6 has reached end-of-life, the default Docker images published for this release (i.e. `1.3.0`, `stable`, `latest`) have been updated to use Python 3.7 instead.

### Removed

#### Python 3.6 No Longer Supported ([#1268](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1268))

As Python 3.6 has reached end-of-life, and many of Nautobot's dependencies have already dropped support for Python 3.6 as a consequence, Nautobot 1.3 and later do not support installation under Python 3.6.
