# Nautobot v2.0

This document describes all new features and changes in Nautobot 2.0.

If you are a user migrating from Nautobot v1.X, please refer to the ["Upgrading from Nautobot v1.X"](../installation/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md) documentation.

## Release Overview

### Added

#### Generic Role Model ([#1063](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1063))

DeviceRole, RackRole, IPAM Role, and IPAddressRoleChoices have all been merged into a single generic Role model. A role can now be created and associated to one or more of the content-types that previously implemented role as a field. These model content-types include dcim.device, dcim.rack, virtualization.virtualmachine, ipam.ipaddress, ipam.prefix, and ipam.vlan.

#### Added Site Fields to Location ([#2954](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2954))

Added Site Model Fields to Location. Location Model now has `asn`, `comments`, `contact_email`, `contact_name`, `contact_phone`, `facility`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `physical_address`, `shipping_address` and `time_zone` fields.

#### Added Depth REST API Query Parameter

Added the `?depth` query parameter in Nautobot v2.X to replace the `?brief` parameter in the REST API. It enables [nested serialization](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/#specifying-nested-serialization) functionality and offers a more dynamic and comprehensive browsable API. It allows users greater control of the API response data and it is available for both retrieving a single object and a list of objects. This parameter is a positive integer value that can range from 0 to 10. To learn more more, check out the [documentation on the `?depth` query parameter](../rest-api/overview.md/#depth-query-parameter).

#### Natural Key Support Across Nautobot Models ([#2900](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2900))

Nautobot's `BaseModel` base class and related classes now implement automatic support for Django [natural keys](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/serialization/#natural-keys) for lookup and referencing, as well as supporting a `natural_key_slug` concept similar to that introduced by `django-natural-keys`. (Nautobot does not depend on `django-natural-keys` but its implementation is heavily inspired by that project.) For example:

```python
>>> DeviceType.objects.first().natural_key()
['MegaCorp', 'Model 9000']

>>> DeviceType.objects.get_by_natural_key("MegaCorp", "Model 9000")
<DeviceType: Model 9000>

>>> DeviceType.objects.first().natural_key_slug
'MegaCorp&Model+9000'

>>> DeviceType.objects.get(natural_key_slug="MegaCorp&Model+9000")
<DeviceType: Model 9000>
```

Developers can refer to the [documentation on natural keys](../development/natural-keys.md) for details on how to support and use this feature.

### Changed

#### Aggregate model Migrated to Prefix ([#3302](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3302))

The `ipam.Aggregate` model has been removed and all existing aggregates will be migrated to `ipam.Prefix` with `type` set to "Container". The `Aggregate.date_added` field will be migrated to `Prefix.date_allocated` and changed from a Date field to a DateTime field with the time set to `00:00`. `Aggregate.tenant`, `Aggregate.rir` and `Aggregate.description` will be migrated over to the same fields on `Prefix`.

See the [upgrade guide](../installation/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#aggregate-migrated-to-prefix) for more details on the data migration.

#### Collapse Region and Site Models into Location ([#2517](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2517))

##### Initial Data Migration

The `Site` and `Region` models have been removed in v2.0 and have been replaced with `Location` of specific `LocationType`. As a result, the existing `Site` and `Region` data will be migrated to corresponding `LocationType` and `Location` objects. Here is what to expect:

1. If you do not have any `Site` and `Region` instances in your existing database, running this data migration will do nothing.
2. If you only have `Region` instances in your existing database, a `LocationType` named **Region** will be created and for each legacy `Region` instance, a corresponding `Location` instance with the same attributes (`id`, `name`, `description`, etc.) and hierarchy will be created.
3. If you only have `Site` instances in your existing database:

    - A `LocationType` named **Site** will be created and every preexisting root level `LocationType` in your database will be updated to have the new **Site** `LocationType` as their parent.

    - For each legacy `Site` instance, a corresponding `Location` instance with the same attributes (`id`, `name`, `description`, `tenant`, `facility`, `asn`, `latitude`, `longitude`, etc.) will be created, and any preexisting `Locations` in your database will be updated to have the appropriate "site" `Locations` as their parents.

    - Model instances that had a `site` field (`CircuitTermination`, `Device`, `PowerPanel`, `RackGroup`, `Rack`, `Prefix`, `VLANGroup`, `VLAN`, `Cluster`) assigned and *did not* have a `location` attribute assigned will be updated to have their `location` point to the new `Location` corresponding to that `Site`. All other attributes on these models will remain unchanged.

    - Model instances that were previously associated to the `ContentType` for `Site` (`ComputedField`, `CustomField`, `CustomLink`, `ExportTemplate`, `ImageAttachment`, `JobHook`, `Note`, `Relationship`, `Status`, `Tag` and `Webhook`) will have their `ContentType` replaced with `Location`. All other attributes on these models will remain unchanged.

    For Example:

    - We will start with a `Site` instance with name **AMS01** as the base `Site` for two top-level `Location` objects with names **root-01** and **root-02** respectively.

    - During the data migration, a `LocationType` named **Site** will be created, and a `Location` of **Site** `LocationType` named **AMS01** with all the information (`asn`, `latitude`, etc.) from the base `Site` will be created.

    - The `Location` objects named **root-01** and **root-02** will have this **AMS01** `Location` set as their `parent`.

4. If you have both `Site` and `Region` instances in your existing database:

    - A `LocationType` named **Region** will be created.

    - For each legacy `Region` instance, a corresponding `Location` instance with the same attributes (`id`, `name`, `description`, etc.) will be created.

    - A `LocationType` named **Site** will be created with the new `LocationType` named **Region** set as its `parent`.

    - Every pre-existing root-level `LocationType` in your database will be updated to have the new `LocationType` named **Site** as its `parent`.

    - For each legacy `Site` instance, a corresponding "site" `Location` instance with the same attributes (`id`, `name`, `description`, `tenant`, `facility`, `asn`, `latitude`, `longitude`, etc.) will be created with its parent set to the corresponding "region" `Location` if any.

        - If you have `Site` instances in your database without a `Region` assigned to them, one additional `Location` named **Global Region** of `LocationType` **Region** will be created and each `Location` of `LocationType` **Site** created from the legacy region-less `Site` instances will have the **Global Region** `Location` as their parent.

    - Model instances that had a `site` attribute (`CircuitTermination`, `Device`, `Location`, `PowerPanel`, `Rack`, `RackGroup`, `Prefix`, `VLANGroup`, `VLAN`, `Cluster`) assigned and *did not* have a `location` attribute assigned will be updated to have their `location` point to the new `Location` of `LocationType` **Site**. All other attributes on these models will remain unchanged.

    - Model instances that were previously associated to the `ContentType` for `Site`  or `Region` (`ComputedField`, `CustomField`, `CustomLink`, `ExportTemplate`, `ImageAttachment`, `JobHook`, `Note`, `Relationship`, `Status`, `Tag` and `Webhook`) will have their `ContentType` replaced with `Location`. All other attributes on these models will remain unchanged.

    For Example:

    - There are two `Site` instances and one `Region` instance in your existing database. The `Region` with name **America** has one child `Site` instance named **AMS01**. And the other `Site` instance named **AUS01** is not associated with any `Region` (`region` attribute is set to `None`).

    - The `Site` **AMS01** is the base `Site` for two top-level `Location` objects with names **root-01** and **root-02** respectively.

    - During the data migration, a `LocationType` named **Region** and a `Location` of this `LocationType` named **America** with all the same information will be created.

    - The `LocationType` named **Site** with its `parent` set as the new `LocationType` **Region** and a `Location` of `LocationType` named **AMS01** with all the same information (`asn`, `latitude`, etc.) will be created. The `Location` **AMS01** will have `Location` **America** as its `parent` and each - `Location` **root-01** and **root-02** will have `Location` **AMS01** as its `parent`.

    - Finally, the `Site` instance **AUS01**, since it does not have a `Region` instance associated with it, its corresponding `Location` **AUS01** will have a new `Location` named **Global Region** of `LocationType` **Region** as its `parent`.

    - In addition, legacy `Site` instance with name **AMS01** also has three `Device` instances associated with it named **ams01-edge-01**, **ams01-edge-02**,  and **ams01-edge-03**.

    - However, **ams01-edge-01** only has its `site` attribute set as `Site` **AMS01** whereas **ams01-edge-02** and **ams01-edge-03** have both its `site` and `location` attributes set `Site` **AMS01** and `Location` **root-01** respectively.

    - During the data migration, **ams01-edge-01**'s `location` attribute will point to the new `Location` of `LocationType` **Site** with name **AMS01** while devices **ams01-edge-02** and **ams01-edge-03** will remain unchanged.

##### Remove Site and Region Related Fields from Models

`Region` and `Site` relationships are being removed from these models: `CircuitTermination`, `Device`, `Location`, `Rack`, `RackGroup`, `PowerFeed`, `PowerPanel`, `ConfigContext`, `Prefix`, `VLAN`, `VLANGroup`, `Cluster`.

The `ContentType` for `Region` and `Site` are being replaced with `Location` on these models: `ComputedField`, `CustomField`, `CustomLink`, `ExportTemplate`, `ImageAttachment`, `JobHook`, `Note`, `Relationship`, `Status`, `Tag` and `Webhook`.

The `region` and `site` fields are being removed in the `filter` data of `DynamicGroup` objects. The previously associated values are being added to the existing `location` field and its associated list of filter values or to a new `location` key with an empty list if one does not exist.

Check out the API and UI endpoints changes incurred by the changes stated above in the ["Upgrading from Nautobot v1.X"](../installation/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md) guide.

#### Collapsed `nautobot.utilities` into `nautobot.core` ([#2721](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2721))

`nautobot.utilities` no longer exists as a separate Python module or Django app. Its functionality has been collapsed into the `nautobot.core` app. See details at [Python Code Location Changes](../installation/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#python-code-location-changes).

#### REST API Versioning Behavior ([#2799](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2799))

In Nautobot 2.0 and later, the REST API defaults, when the caller doesn't request a specific API version, to using the latest available version of the REST API. This is a change from Nautobot 1.x, where the default behavior was to use the 1.2 version of the REST API even when newer versions were available.

#### Revamped CSV Import and Export ([#2569](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2569), [#3715](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3715))

Exporting objects and lists of objects to CSV format has been totally reimplemented in a new framework for ease of use and maintainability. Instead of accessing `http://nautobot/<app>/<model>/?export` you will now use the URL pattern `http://nautobot/api/<app>/<model>/?format=csv`, as the new CSV renderer is based on the REST API serializer definitions. This results in substantially more comprehensive CSV representations of many models.

Conversely, importing objects from CSV format has also been reimplemented in the same new framework. The REST API can now accept CSV files as well as the existing JSON support, and the UI for importing CSVs uses this same framework behind the scenes.

An immediate benefit you can notice from this reimplementation is that CSVs should now **generally** be "round-trip" capable, meaning that you can export a set of records to CSV format and then import that CSV into a different Nautobot instance (or delete the records and use the CSV to recreate them) without needing to "massage" the CSV into a different set of columns or fields.

#### Renamed Database Foreign Keys and Related Names ([#2520](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2520))

Some Foreign Key fields have been renamed to follow a more self-consistent pattern across the Nautobot app. This change is aimed to offer more clarity and predictability when it comes to related object database operations:

For example in v1.x to create a circuit object with `type` "circuit-type-1", you would do:

```python
Circuit.objects.create(
    cid="Circuit 1",
    provider="provider-1",
    type="circuit-type-1",
    status="active",
)
```

and to filter `Circuit` objects of `type` "circuit-type-2", you would do:

```python
Circuit.objects.filter(type="circuit-type-2")
```

Now in v2.x, we have renamed the Foreign Key field `type` on Circuit Model to `circuit_type`, because this naming convention made it clearer that this Foregin Key field is pointing to the model `CircuitType`. The same operations would look like:

```python
Circuit.objects.create(
    cid="Circuit 1",
    provider="provider-1",
    circuit_type="circuit-type-1",
    status="active",
)
```

```python
Circuit.objects.filter(circuit_type="circuit-type-2")
```

Check out more Foreign Key related changes documented in the table [Renamed Database Fields](../installation/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#renamed-database-fields)

In addition to the changes made to Foreign Key fields' own names, some of their `related_names` are also renamed:

For example in v1.x, to query `Circuit` objects with `CircuitTermination` instances located in sites ["ams01", "ams02", "atl03"], you would do:

```python
Circuit.objects.filter(terminations__site__in=["ams01", "ams02", "atl03"])
```

Now in v2.x, we have renamed the Foreign Key field `circuit`'s `related_name` attribute `terminations` on `CircuitTermination` Model to `circuit_terminations`, the same operations would look like:

```python
Circuit.objects.filter(circuit_terminations__site__in=["ams01", "ams02", "atl03"])
```

Check out more `related-name` changes documented in the table [Renamed Database Fields](../installation/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#renamed-database-fields)

#### Renamed Filter Fields ([#2804](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2804))

Some filter fields have been renamed to reflect their functionalities better.

For example in v1.X, to filter `FrontPorts` that has a cable attached in the UI or make changes to them via Rest API, you would use the `cabled` filter:

`/dcim/front-ports/?cabled=True`

Now in v2.x, you would instead use the `has_cable` filter which has a more user-friendly name:

`/dcim/front-ports/?has_cable=True`

Check out the specific changes documented in the table at [UI and REST API Filter Changes](../installation/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#renamed-filter-fields)

#### Enhanced Filter Fields ([#2804](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2804))

Many filter fields have been enhanced to enable filtering by both slugs and UUID primary keys.

For example in v1.X, to filter `Regions` with a specific `parent` value in the UI or make changes to them via Rest API, you are only able to input slugs as the filter values:

`/dcim/regions/?parent=<slug>`

Now in v2.x, you are able to filter those `Regions` by slugs or UUID primary keys:

`/dcim/regions/?parent=<slug>` or `/dcim/regions/?parent=<uuid>`

Check out the specific changes documented in the table at [UI and REST API Filter Changes](../installation/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#enhanced-filter-fields)

#### Corrected Filter Fields ([#2804](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2804))

There were also instances where a foreign-key related field (e.g. `console_ports`) was incorrectly mapped to a boolean membership filter (e.g. `has_console_ports`), making it impossible to filter based on specific values of the foreign key:

For example in v1.x:

`/dcim/devices/?console_ports=True` and `/dcim/devices/?has_console_ports=True` are functionally the same and this behavior is **incorrect**.

This has been addressed in v2.x as follows:

`console_ports` and similar filters are taking foreign key UUIDs as input values and can be used in this format: `/dcim/devices/?console_ports=<uuid>` whereas `has_console_ports` and similar filters remain the same.

Check out the specific changes documented in the table at [UI and REST API Filter Changes](../installation/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#corrected-filter-fields)

#### Generic Role Model ([#1063](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1063))

The `DeviceRole`, `RackRole`, `ipam.Role`, and `IPAddressRoleChoices` have all been removed and replaced with a `extras.Role` model, This means that all references to any of the replaced models and choices now points to this generic role model.

In addition, the `role` field of the `IPAddress` model has also been changed from a choice field to a foreign key related field to the `extras.Role` model.

#### Prefix `is_pool` field and "Container" status replaced by new field `Prefix.type` ([#1362](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1362))

A new `type` field was added to `Prefix` to replace the `is_pool` boolean field and the "Container" status. The `type` field can be set to "Network", "Pool" or "Container", with "Network" being the default.

Existing prefixes with a status of "Container" will be migrated to the "Container" type. Existing prefixes with `is_pool` set will be migrated to the "Pool" type. Prefixes with both `is_pool` set and a status of "Container" will be migrated to the "Pool" type.

The "Container" status will be removed and all prefixes will be migrated to the "Active" status if it exists. If the "Active" status was deleted, prefixes will be migrated to the first available prefix status in the database that is not "Container".

### Removed

#### Removed Brief REST API Query Parameter

Support for `?brief` REST API query parameter and `Nested*Serializers` have been removed in Nautobot v2.X. They are replaced by the new [`?depth` query parameter](../rest-api/overview.md/#depth-query-parameter).

#### Removed `django-cacheops` ([#1721](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1721))

Nautobot no longer uses `django-cacheops` for caching of database queries or other information. In some cases this has been replaced by the use of Django's native Redis caching capabilities.

The configuration settings `CACHEOPS`, `CACHEOPS_DEFAULTS`, `CACHEOPS_DEGRADE_ON_FAILURE`, `CACHEOPS_ENABLED`, `CACHEOPS_HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED`, `CACHEOPS_REDIS`, etc. are now unused by Nautobot and may be removed from your configuration.

#### Removed Redundant Filter Fields ([#2804](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2804))

As a part of breaking changes made in v2.X, shadowed filter/filterset fields are being removed throughout Nautobot.

In Nautobot 1.x, for some of the foreign-key related fields:
    - The field was shadowed for the purpose of replacing the PK filter with a lookup-based on a more human-readable value (typically `slug`, if available).
    - A PK-based filter was available as well, generally with a name suffixed by `_id`

Now these two filter fields will be replaced by a single filter field that can support both slugs and UUID primary keys as inputs; As a result, PK-based filters suffixed by `_id` will no longer be supported in v2.0.

For example in v1.X, to filter `Devices` with a specific `site` value in the UI or make changes to them via Rest API with a UUID primary key, you will use:

`/dcim/devices/?site_id=<uuid>`

Now in v2.x, that format is no longer supported. Instead, you would use:

`/dcim/devices/?site=<uuid>`

Check out the specific changes documented in the table at [UI and REST API Filter Changes](../installation/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#removed-redundant-filter-fields)

#### Removed RQ support ([#2523](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issue/2523))

Support for RQ and `django-rq`, deprecated since Nautobot 1.1.0, has been fully removed from Nautobot 2.0.

### Changed

- [#1633](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1633) - The base class for all `tags` fields on `PrimaryModel` subclasses is now `nautobot.core.models.fields.TagsField` rather than `taggit.managers.TaggableManager`. Any apps using `PrimaryModel` as a base class will likely need to generate and run a schema migration to reflect this change.
- [#2331](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2331) - Changed `JobLogEntry.log_level` choices from `default`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, `failure` to Python default logging levels `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error` and `critical`.
- [#2331](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2331) - Changed job logging from custom log methods on the `BaseJob` class to celery's `get_task_logger` logging implementation.
- [#2569](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2569) - Revamped CSV export functionality to use REST API serializers for more self-consistency and reduced boilerplate.
- [#2569](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2569) - Revised the natural key for `SecretsGroupAssociation` through-table model.
- [#2569](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2569) - Changed behavior of `JobLogEntry.display` REST API field to match the model behavior.
