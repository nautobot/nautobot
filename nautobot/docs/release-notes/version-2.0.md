# Nautobot v2.0

This document describes all new features and changes in Nautobot 2.0.

If you are a user migrating from Nautobot v1.X, please refer to the ["Upgrading from Nautobot v1.X"](../installation/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md) documentation.

## Release Overview

### Added

### Changed

#### Enhanced Filter Fields ([#2804](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2804))

In nautobot v2.X, we changed some of the filter fields to enable filtering by both slugs and UUID primary keys:

For example in v1.X, to filter `Regions` with a specific `parent` value in the UI or make changes to them via Rest API, you are only able to input slugs as the filter values:

`/dcim/regions/?parent=<slug>`

Now in v2.x, you are able to filter those `Regions` by slugs or UUID primary keys:

`/dcim/regions/?parent=<slug>` or `/dcim/regions/?parent=<uuid>`

#### Corrected Filter Fields ([#2804](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2804))

There were also instances where a foreign-key related field (e.g. `console_ports`) was incorrectly mapped to a boolean membership filter (e.g. `has_console_ports`), making it impossible to filter based on specific values of the foreign key:

For example in v1.x:

`/dcim/devices/?console_ports=True` and `/dcim/devices/?has_console_ports=True` are functionally the same and this behavior is **incorrect**.

This has been addressed in v2.x as follows:

`console_ports` and similar filters are taking foreign key UUIDs as input values and can be used in this format: `/dcim/devices/?console_ports=<uuid>` whereas `has_console_ports` and similar filters remain the same.

### Removed

#### Removed Redundant Filter Fields ([#2804](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2804))

As a part of breaking changes made in v2.X, shadowed filter/filterset fields are being removed in the DCIM app:

Currently for some of the foreign-key related fields:
    - The field is shadowed for the purpose of replacing the PK filter with a lookup-based on a more human-readable value (typically `slug`, if available).
    - A PK-based filter is available as well, generally with a name suffixed by `_id`

Now these two filter fields will be replaced by a single filter field that can support both slugs and UUID primary keys as inputs; As a result, PK-based filters suffixed by `_id` will no longer be supported in v2.0.

For example in v1.X, to filter `Devices` with a specific `site` value in the UI or make changes to them via Rest API with a UUID primary key, you will use:

`/dcim/devices/?site_id=<uuid>`

Now in v2.x, that format is no longer supported. Instead, you would use:

`/dcim/devices/?site=<uuid>`
