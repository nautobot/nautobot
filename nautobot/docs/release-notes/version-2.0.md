!!! note
    Please thoroughly review the release overview below to see what changes may affect you during upgrade. Our ["Upgrading from Nautobot v1.X"](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md) guide provides a lot of information around pre- and post-migration helpers we have written that should assist you in a successful 2.0 upgrade. If you have any questions, please reach out to us on the **#nautobot** channel on [Network to Code's Slack community](https://slack.networktocode.com/) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/discussions).

## Release Overview

### Added

#### Alpha UI 2.0 ([#3142](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3142))

Nautobot 2.0 includes an "alpha" version of a new user interface (UI) for Nautobot, based on the React web framework.

Users can switch between the existing UI and new UI for views supported in the new UI via a "View in New UI" link in the page footer of the existing UI and a "Return to Legacy UI" link in the left sidebar of the new UI.

!!! tip
    The new UI also includes a "Submit Feedback" link that can be used to easily submit feedback regarding the new UI to the Nautobot maintainers.

As of Nautobot release 2.0.0, the new UI supports read-only access to Locations, Device Types, Devices, Prefixes, and IP Addresses; these views will be enhanced and refined, and support for additional models and workflows will be added, throughout the Nautobot 2.x release lifecycle.

!!! info
    As of Nautobot release 2.0.0, the new UI, as an alpha feature, does not yet support Nautobot Apps (plugins), but this capability will be added and supported in a future release.

#### Assign an IP Address to Multiple Interfaces ([#2403](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2403))

Introduced the ability to assign one `IPAddress` to multiple `Interfaces`/`Devices` and `VMInterfaces`/`VirtualMachines` by creating a many to many relationship between `IPAddress` and `Interface`/`VMInterface` models represented as a through table model [`IPAddressToInterface`](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#new-interface-to-ip-address-relationship-endpoint). This feature allows you to model a network environment where you have anycast `IPAddresses` are shared extensively among a large number of `Devices`/`VirtualMachines`.

As a result of this feature and associated changes, you can no longer assign `Interfaces`/`VMInterfaces` during bulk creation of `IPAddresses`, but a separate bulk-create endpoint has been [introduced](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4522) to allow the bulk import of `IPAddressToInterface` assignments.

#### Generic Role Model ([#1063](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1063))

`DeviceRole`, `RackRole`, IPAM `Role`, and `IPAddressRoleChoices` have all been merged into a single generic `Role` model. A `Role`can now be created and associated to one or more of the content-types that support reference to a `role`. These model content-types include `dcim.device`, `dcim.rack`, `virtualization.virtualmachine`, `ipam.ipaddress`, `ipam.prefix`, and `ipam.vlan`.

#### IPAM Namespaces ([#3337](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3337))

The new Namespace model expands on the functionality previously provided by `VRF.enforce_unique` and the `ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE` settings flag, both of which have now been removed. Within a namespace, all VRFs, prefixes, and IP addresses must be unique and non-duplicated. For more details please refer to the [documentation](../user-guide/core-data-model/ipam/namespace.md).

#### Natural Key Support Across Nautobot Models ([#2900](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2900))

Nautobot's `BaseModel` base class and related classes now implement automatic support for Django [natural keys](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/serialization/#natural-keys) for lookup and referencing. For example:

```python
>>> DeviceType.objects.first().natural_key()
['MegaCorp', 'Model 9000']

>>> DeviceType.objects.get_by_natural_key("MegaCorp", "Model 9000")
<DeviceType: Model 9000>
```

Developers can refer to the [documentation on natural keys](../development/core/natural-keys.md) for details on how to support and use this feature.

Two new configuration settings, [`DEVICE_NAME_AS_NATURAL_KEY`](../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#device_name_as_natural_key) and [`LOCATION_NAME_AS_NATURAL_KEY`](../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#location_name_as_natural_key), have been added to allow an administrator to customize the natural-key behavior of these two widely-used models.

#### REST API Query Depth Parameter ([#3042](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3042))

Added the `?depth` query parameter in Nautobot v2.X to replace the `?brief` parameter in the REST API. It enables [nested serialization](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/#specifying-nested-serialization) functionality and offers a more dynamic and comprehensive browsable API. It allows users greater control of the API response data and it is available for both retrieving a single object and a list of objects. This parameter is a positive integer value that can range from 0 to 10. To learn more more, check out the [documentation on the `?depth` query parameter](../user-guide/platform-functionality/rest-api/overview.md/#depth-query-parameter).

#### Site Fields Added to Location ([#2954](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2954))

Added Site Model Fields to Location. Location Model now has `asn`, `comments`, `contact_email`, `contact_name`, `contact_phone`, `facility`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `physical_address`, `shipping_address` and `time_zone` fields.

### Changed

#### Aggregate Model Migrated to Prefix ([#3302](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3302))

The `ipam.Aggregate` model has been removed and all existing aggregates will be migrated to `ipam.Prefix` with `type` set to "Container". The `Aggregate.date_added` field will be migrated to `Prefix.date_allocated` and changed from a Date field to a DateTime field with the time set to `00:00`. `Aggregate.tenant`, `Aggregate.rir` and `Aggregate.description` will be migrated over to the same fields on `Prefix`.

See the [upgrade guide](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#aggregate-migrated-to-prefix) for more details on the data migration.

#### Changed `created` Field to DateTimeField for ChangeLoggedModel ([#2076](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2076))

The `created` field of all models that inherit from `ChangedLoggedModel`, which includes `OrganizationalModel` and `PrimaryModel` and therefore most objects in the core data model, has been changed from a `DateField` to a `DateTimeField` for added granularity. Preexisting records will show as created at midnight UTC on their original creation date.

All such objects may now be filtered by date or time or a combination of both. All other date-based behavior such as filtering works as it did before.

#### Collapsed `nautobot.utilities` into `nautobot.core` ([#2721](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2721))

`nautobot.utilities` no longer exists as a separate Python module or Django app. Its functionality has been collapsed into the `nautobot.core` app. See details at [Python Code Location Changes](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#python-code-location-changes).

#### Collapsed Region and Site Models into Location ([#2517](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2517))

##### Initial Data Migration

The `Site` and `Region` models have been removed in v2.0 and have been replaced with `Location` of specific `LocationType`. As a result, the existing `Site` and `Region` data will be migrated to corresponding `LocationType` and `Location` objects. Here is what to expect:

1. If you do not have any `Site` and `Region` instances in your existing database, running this data migration will do nothing.
2. If you only have `Region` instances in your existing database, a `LocationType` named **Region** will be created and for each legacy `Region` instance, a corresponding `Location` instance with the same attributes (`id`, `name`, `description`, etc.) and hierarchy will be created.
3. If you only have `Site` instances in your existing database:

    - A `LocationType` named **Site** will be created and every preexisting root level `LocationType` in your database will be updated to have the new **Site** `LocationType` as their parent.

    - For each legacy `Site` instance, a corresponding `Location` instance with the same attributes (`id`, `name`, `description`, `tenant`, `facility`, `asn`, `latitude`, `longitude`, etc.) will be created, and any preexisting `Locations` in your database will be updated to have the appropriate "site" `Locations` as their parents.

    - Model instances that had a `site` field (`CircuitTermination`, `Device`, `PowerPanel`, `RackGroup`, `Rack`, `Prefix`, `VLANGroup`, `VLAN`, `Cluster`) assigned and *did not* have a `location` attribute assigned will be updated to have their `location` point to the new `Location` corresponding to that `Site`. All other attributes on these models will remain unchanged.

    - Model instances that were previously associated to the `ContentType` for `Site` (`ComputedField`, `CustomField`, `CustomLink`, `ExportTemplate`, `ImageAttachment`, `JobHook`, `Note`, `Relationship`, `Status`, `Tag` and `Webhook`) will have their `ContentType` replaced with `Location`. All other attributes on these models will remain unchanged.

    For Example:

    - We will start with a `Site` instance with name **AMS01** as the base `Site` for two top-level `Location` objects with names **root-01** and **root-02** respectively.

    - During the data migration, a `LocationType` named **Site** will be created, and a `Location` of **Site** `LocationType` named **AMS01** with all the information (`asn`, `latitude`, etc.) from the base `Site` will be created.

    - The `Location` objects named **root-01** and **root-02** will have this **AMS01** `Location` set as their `parent`.

4. If you have both `Site` and `Region` instances in your existing database:

    - A `LocationType` named **Region** will be created.

    - For each legacy `Region` instance, a corresponding `Location` instance with the same attributes (`id`, `name`, `description`, etc.) will be created.

    - A `LocationType` named **Site** will be created with the new `LocationType` named **Region** set as its `parent`.

    - Every pre-existing root-level `LocationType` in your database will be updated to have the new `LocationType` named **Site** as its `parent`.

    - For each legacy `Site` instance, a corresponding "site" `Location` instance with the same attributes (`id`, `name`, `description`, `tenant`, `facility`, `asn`, `latitude`, `longitude`, etc.) will be created with its parent set to the corresponding "region" `Location` if any.

        - If you have `Site` instances in your database without a `Region` assigned to them, one additional `Location` named **Global Region** of `LocationType` **Region** will be created and each `Location` of `LocationType` **Site** created from the legacy region-less `Site` instances will have the **Global Region** `Location` as their parent.

    - Model instances that had a `site` attribute (`CircuitTermination`, `Device`, `Location`, `PowerPanel`, `Rack`, `RackGroup`, `Prefix`, `VLANGroup`, `VLAN`, `Cluster`) assigned and *did not* have a `location` attribute assigned will be updated to have their `location` point to the new `Location` of `LocationType` **Site**. All other attributes on these models will remain unchanged.

    - Model instances that were previously associated to the `ContentType` for `Site`  or `Region` (`ComputedField`, `CustomField`, `CustomLink`, `ExportTemplate`, `ImageAttachment`, `JobHook`, `Note`, `Relationship`, `Status`, `Tag` and `Webhook`) will have their `ContentType` replaced with `Location`. All other attributes on these models will remain unchanged.

    For Example:

    - There are two `Site` instances and one `Region` instance in your existing database. The `Region` with name **America** has one child `Site` instance named **AMS01**. And the other `Site` instance named **AUS01** is not associated with any `Region` (`region` attribute is set to `None`).

    - The `Site` **AMS01** is the base `Site` for two top-level `Location` objects with names **root-01** and **root-02** respectively.

    - During the data migration, a `LocationType` named **Region** and a `Location` of this `LocationType` named **America** with all the same information will be created.

    - The `LocationType` named **Site** with its `parent` set as the new `LocationType` **Region** and a `Location` of `LocationType` named **AMS01** with all the same information (`asn`, `latitude`, etc.) will be created. The `Location` **AMS01** will have `Location` **America** as its `parent` and each - `Location` **root-01** and **root-02** will have `Location` **AMS01** as its `parent`.

    - Finally, the `Site` instance **AUS01**, since it does not have a `Region` instance associated with it, its corresponding `Location` **AUS01** will have a new `Location` named **Global Region** of `LocationType` **Region** as its `parent`.

    - In addition, legacy `Site` instance with name **AMS01** also has three `Device` instances associated with it named **ams01-edge-01**, **ams01-edge-02**,  and **ams01-edge-03**.

    - However, **ams01-edge-01** only has its `site` attribute set as `Site` **AMS01** whereas **ams01-edge-02** and **ams01-edge-03** have both its `site` and `location` attributes set `Site` **AMS01** and `Location` **root-01** respectively.

    - During the data migration, **ams01-edge-01**'s `location` attribute will point to the new `Location` of `LocationType` **Site** with name **AMS01** while devices **ams01-edge-02** and **ams01-edge-03** will remain unchanged.

##### Remove Site and Region Related Fields from Models

`Region` and `Site` relationships are being removed from these models: `CircuitTermination`, `Device`, `Location`, `Rack`, `RackGroup`, `PowerFeed`, `PowerPanel`, `ConfigContext`, `Prefix`, `VLAN`, `VLANGroup`, `Cluster`.

The `ContentType` for `Region` and `Site` are being replaced with `Location` on these models: `ComputedField`, `CustomField`, `CustomLink`, `ExportTemplate`, `ImageAttachment`, `JobHook`, `Note`, `Relationship`, `Status`, `Tag` and `Webhook`.

The `region` and `site` fields are being removed in the `filter` data of `DynamicGroup` objects. The previously associated values are being added to the existing `location` field and its associated list of filter values or to a new `location` key with an empty list if one does not exist.

Check out the API and UI endpoints changes incurred by the changes stated above in the ["Upgrading from Nautobot v1.X"](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md) guide.

#### Corrected Filter Fields ([#2804](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2804))

!!! warning
    This change may introduce breaking changes to your existing `DynamicGroup` filters, `ObjectPermission` filters, `Relationship` filters, and any other saved references to these fields. You should review any existing instances of these models before and after upgrading your production environment for any potentially subtle change. Please refer to the [Upgrading from Nautobot v1.X](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#corrected-filter-fields) guide for more details.

There were also instances where a foreign-key related field (e.g. `console_ports`) was incorrectly mapped to a boolean membership filter (e.g. `has_console_ports`), making it impossible to filter based on specific values of the foreign key:

For example in v1.x:

`/dcim/devices/?console_ports=True` and `/dcim/devices/?has_console_ports=True` are functionally the same and this behavior is **incorrect**.

This has been addressed in v2.x as follows:

`console_ports` and similar filters are taking foreign key UUIDs as input values and can be used in this format: `/dcim/devices/?console_ports=<uuid>` whereas `has_console_ports` and similar filters remain the same.

Check out the specific changes documented in the table at [UI and REST API Filter Changes](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#corrected-filter-fields)

#### Enhanced Filter Fields ([#2804](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2804))

!!! warning
    This change may introduce breaking changes to your existing `DynamicGroup` filters, `ObjectPermission` filters, `Relationship` filters, and any other saved references to these fields. You should review any existing instances of these models before and after upgrading your production environment for any potentially subtle change. Please refer to the [Upgrading from Nautobot v1.X](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#enhanced-filter-fields) guide for more details.

Many filter fields have been enhanced to enable filtering by both names and UUID primary keys.

For example in v1.X, to filter `RackGroups` with a specific `parent` value in the UI or make changes to them via the REST API, you could only to input slugs as the filter values:

`/dcim/rack-groups/?parent=<slug>`

Now in v2.x, you are able to filter those `RackGroups` by their parent(s) names or UUID primary keys:

`/dcim/rack-groups/?parent=<name>` or `/dcim/rack-groups/?parent=<uuid>`

Check out the specific changes documented in the table at [UI and REST API Filter Changes](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#enhanced-filter-fields)

#### Generic Role Model ([#1063](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1063))

The `DeviceRole`, `RackRole`, `ipam.Role`, and `IPAddressRoleChoices` have all been removed and replaced with a `extras.Role` model, This means that all references to any of the replaced models and choices now points to this generic role model.

In addition, the `role` field of the `IPAddress` model has also been changed from a choice field to a foreign key related field to the `extras.Role` model.

#### Job Overhaul ([#765](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/765))

Within Nautobot 2.0, Jobs has undergone significant changes within the overall functionality of Jobs along with migration for existing 1.x Jobs operation. Database changes for Jobs will affect DryRun functionality. Other significant changes to Jobs in 2.0 provide greater interoperability with Celery for registering, logging, and tracking however 2.0 will be moving away from previous backwards compatibility scripts. These improvements will simplify Job implementation and help reduce administration overhead for status tracking on completions and/or failures. For more details, refer to [Migrating Jobs from Nautobot v1.X to Nautobot v2.0](../development/jobs/migration/from-v1.md).

#### Prefix `is_pool` Field and "Container" Status replaced by New Field `Prefix.type` ([#1362](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1362))

A new `type` field was added to `Prefix` to replace the `is_pool` boolean field and the "Container" status. The `type` field can be set to "Network", "Pool" or "Container", with "Network" being the default.

Existing prefixes with a status of "Container" will be migrated to the "Container" type. Existing prefixes with `is_pool` set will be migrated to the "Pool" type. Prefixes with both `is_pool` set and a status of "Container" will be migrated to the "Pool" type.

The "Container" status will be removed and all prefixes will be migrated to the "Active" status if it exists. If the "Active" status was deleted, prefixes will be migrated to the first available prefix status in the database that is not "Container".

#### Renamed Database Foreign Keys and Related Names ([#2520](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2520))

!!! warning
    This change may introduce breaking changes to your existing `DynamicGroup` filters, `ObjectPermission` filters, `Relationship` filters, and any other saved references to these fields. You should review any existing instances of these models before and after upgrading your production environment for any potentially subtle change. Please refer to the [Upgrading from Nautobot v1.X](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#renamed-database-fields) guide for more details.

Some Foreign Key fields have been renamed to follow a more self-consistent pattern across the Nautobot app. This change is aimed to offer more clarity and predictability when it comes to related object database operations:

For example in v1.x to create a circuit object with `type` "circuit-type-1", you would do:

```python
Circuit.objects.create(
    cid="Circuit 1",
    provider="provider-1",
    type="circuit-type-1",
    status="active",
)
```

and to filter `Circuit` objects of `type` "circuit-type-2", you would do:

```python
Circuit.objects.filter(type="circuit-type-2")
```

Now in v2.x, we have renamed the Foreign Key field `type` on Circuit Model to `circuit_type`, because this naming convention made it clearer that this Foregin Key field is pointing to the model `CircuitType`. The same operations would look like:

```python
Circuit.objects.create(
    cid="Circuit 1",
    provider="provider-1",
    circuit_type="circuit-type-1",
    status="active",
)
```

```python
Circuit.objects.filter(circuit_type="circuit-type-2")
```

Check out more Foreign Key related changes documented in the table [Renamed Database Fields](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#renamed-database-fields)

In addition to the changes made to Foreign Key fields' own names, some of their `related_names` are also renamed:

For example in v1.x, to query `Circuit` objects with `CircuitTermination` instances located in sites ["ams01", "ams02", "atl03"], you would do:

```python
Circuit.objects.filter(terminations__site__in=["ams01", "ams02", "atl03"])
```

Now in v2.x, we have renamed the Foreign Key field `circuit`'s `related_name` attribute `terminations` on `CircuitTermination` Model to `circuit_terminations`, the same operations would look like:

```python
Circuit.objects.filter(circuit_terminations__site__in=["ams01", "ams02", "atl03"])
```

Check out more `related-name` changes documented in the table [Renamed Database Fields](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#renamed-database-fields)

#### Renamed Filter Fields ([#2804](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2804))

!!! warning
    This change may introduce breaking changes to your existing `DynamicGroup` filters, `ObjectPermission` filters, `Relationship` filters, and any other saved references to these fields. You should review any existing instances of these models before and after upgrading your production environment for any potentially subtle change. Please refer to the [Upgrading from Nautobot v1.X](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#renamed-filter-fields) guide for more details.

Some filter fields have been renamed to reflect their functionalities better.

For example in v1.X, to filter `FrontPorts` that has a cable attached in the UI or make changes to them via Rest API, you would use the `cabled` filter:

`/dcim/front-ports/?cabled=True`

Now in v2.x, you would instead use the `has_cable` filter which has a more user-friendly name:

`/dcim/front-ports/?has_cable=True`

Check out the specific changes documented in the table at [UI and REST API Filter Changes](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#renamed-filter-fields)

#### REST API Versioning Behavior ([#2799](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2799))

In Nautobot 2.0 and later, the REST API defaults, when the caller doesn't request a specific API version, to using the latest available version of the REST API. This is a change from Nautobot 1.x, where the default behavior was to use the 1.2 version of the REST API even when newer versions were available.

#### Revamped CSV Import and Export ([#254](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/254))

Exporting objects and lists of objects to CSV format has been totally reimplemented in a new framework for ease of use and maintainability. Instead of accessing `http://nautobot/<app>/<model>/?export` users can now use the URL pattern `http://nautobot/api/<app>/<model>/?format=csv` (the "Export" links in the UI have of course been updated accordingly), as the new CSV rendering for exports is based on the REST API serializer definitions. This results in substantially more comprehensive CSV representations of many models.

Conversely, importing objects from CSV format has also been reimplemented in the same new framework. The REST API can now accept CSV files as well as the existing JSON support, and the UI for importing CSVs uses this same framework behind the scenes.

!!! warning
    The Nautobot 2.0 CSV formats for exports and imports are **not** backwards-compatible with the Nautobot 1.x CSV formats. In general, the CSV formats are subject to refinement in future releases, and should **not** be considered a stable API for data portability between differing Nautobot versions.

An immediate benefit users can notice from this reimplementation is that CSVs should now **generally** be "round-trip" capable, meaning that you can export a set of records to CSV format and then import that CSV into a different Nautobot instance (or delete the records and use the CSV to recreate them) without needing to "massage" the CSV into a different set of columns or fields. One caveat to this is many-to-many fields (such as `VRF.import_targets` or `Interface.tagged_vlans`), which are not currently included in CSV exports or supported for CSV import, with the exception of object `tags` which are supported. Support for many-to-many export and import via CSV may be added in a future release.

A benefit to App developers is that data models no longer need to define a `csv_headers` attribute or implement a `to_csv` method, because implementing the REST API for a model is now sufficient to enable CSV import/export support for that model. Similarly, there is no longer a need to implement a `CSVForm` for each model in order to support CSV import.

In addition to the above improvements, you can now reference related objects in your CSV by using a combination of unique fields. For instance:

Instead of:

```csv
name,rack
Device one,7f3ca431-8103-45cc-a9ce-b94c1f784a1d
```

you can use:

```csv
name,rack__location__name,rack__name
Device one,Equinix DC6,R204
```

This enhancement allows you to specify related objects using their unique attributes, making data import even more intuitive and flexible.

### Removed

#### Brief REST API Query Parameter ([#3042](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/3042))

Support for `?brief` REST API query parameter and `Nested*Serializers` have been removed in Nautobot v2.X. They are replaced by the new [`?depth` query parameter](../user-guide/platform-functionality/rest-api/overview.md/#depth-query-parameter).

#### `django-cacheops` ([#1721](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1721))

Nautobot no longer uses `django-cacheops` for caching of database queries or other information. In some cases this has been replaced by the use of Django's native Redis caching capabilities.

The configuration settings `CACHEOPS`, `CACHEOPS_DEFAULTS`, `CACHEOPS_DEGRADE_ON_FAILURE`, `CACHEOPS_ENABLED`, `CACHEOPS_HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED`, `CACHEOPS_REDIS`, etc. are now unused by Nautobot and may be removed from your configuration.

#### Legacy `manage.py` Removed ([#1634](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1634))

When we launched Nautobot we introduced the `nautobot-server` command as the primary entrypoint to managing your application, replacing the legacy `manage.py` script that is common with Django-based applications. The original `manage.py` was left there initially in v1.0.0 as a fallback, however it is no longer needed, so we have removed it in Nautobot 2.0.

#### Redundant Filter Fields ([#2804](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/2804))

!!! warning
    This change may introduce breaking changes to your existing `DynamicGroup` filters, `ObjectPermission` filters, `Relationship` filters, and any other saved references to these fields. You should review any existing instances of these models before and after upgrading your production environment for any potentially subtle change. Please refer to the [Upgrading from Nautobot v1.X](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#removed-redundant-filter-fields) guide for more details.

As a part of breaking changes made in v2.X, shadowed filter/filterset fields are being removed throughout Nautobot.

In Nautobot 1.x, for some of the foreign-key related fields:
    - The field was shadowed for the purpose of replacing the PK filter with a lookup-based on a more human-readable value (typically `slug`, if available).
    - A PK-based filter was available as well, generally with a name suffixed by `_id`

Now these two filter fields will be replaced by a single filter field that can support both names and UUID primary keys as inputs; As a result, PK-based filters suffixed by `_id` will no longer be supported in v2.0.

For example in v1.X, to filter `Circuits` with a specific `provider` value in the UI or make changes to them via the REST API with a UUID primary key, you would use:

`/circuits/circuits/?provider_id=<uuid>`

Now in v2.x, that format is no longer supported. Instead, you would use:

`/circuits/circuits/?provider=<uuid>`

Check out the specific changes documented in the table at [UI and REST API Filter Changes](../user-guide/administration/upgrading/from-v1/upgrading-from-nautobot-v1.md#removed-redundant-filter-fields)

#### RQ support ([#2523](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issue/2523))

Support for RQ and `django-rq`, deprecated since Nautobot 1.1.0, has been fully removed from Nautobot 2.0.

#### Slug Fields ([#2662](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/2662))

The `slug` field has been removed from all core models except for `GitRepository`. Generally, Nautobot URLs that referenced the `slug` field have been changed to use the primary key instead. For example, the URL for `https://nautobot/dcim/locations/building-01` would change to a URL similar to `https://nautobot/dcim/locations/e41f381a-a53b-485a-886f-9d36859b47a1`. There are a small number of URLs that still reference a value that's not the primary key, including some URLs related to secrets providers, cables and jobs.

A `natural_slug` property has been added to all models that inherit from `BaseModel` to provide a human-readable value for use in tools that require a loose reference to a Nautobot object, but this value is not equivalent to the `slug` field and is not guaranteed to be unique.

A natural key interface has been provided for most models to allow for uniquely referencing objects by a name that is friendlier than the primary key. For more information on the usage of natural keys vs primary keys see the documentation for [Uniquely Identifying a Nautobot Object](../development/apps/api/platform-features/uniquely-identify-objects.md).
