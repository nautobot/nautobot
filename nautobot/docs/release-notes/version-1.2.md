# Nautobot v1.2

This document describes all new features and changes in Nautobot 1.2.

If you are a user migrating from NetBox to Nautobot, please refer to the ["Migrating from NetBox"](../installation/migrating-from-netbox.md) documentation.

## Release Overview

### Added

#### Common Base Template for Object Detail Views ([#479](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/479))

All "object detail" views (pages displaying details of a single Nautobot record) now inherit from a common base template, providing improved UI consistency, reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed to create a new detail view, and fixing a number of bugs in various views. Plugin developers are encouraged to make use of this new template (`generic/object_detail.html`) to take advantage of these improvements.

#### Custom Fields are now User Configurable ([#229](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/229))

Creation and management of Custom Field definitions can now be performed by any user with appropriate permissions. (Previously, only admin users were able to manage Custom Fields.)

#### Custom Field Webhooks ([#519](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/519))

Webhooks can now be triggered when creating/updating/deleting `CustomField` and `CustomFieldChoice` definition records.

#### Database Ready Signal ([#13](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/13))

After running `nautobot-server migrate` or `nautobot-server post_upgrade`, Nautobot now emits a custom signal, `nautobot_database_ready`. This signal is designed for plugins to connect to in order to perform automatic database population (such as defining custom fields, relationships, webhooks, etc.) at install/upgrade time. For more details, refer to [the plugin development documentation](../plugins/development.md#populating-extensibility-features).

#### Plugin Banners ([#534](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/534))

Each plugin is now able to inject a custom banner into any of the Nautobot core views.

#### Software-Defined Home Page ([#674](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/674), [#716](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/716))

Nautobot core applications and plugins can now both define panels, groups, and items to populate the Nautobot home page. The home page now dynamically reflows to accommodate available content. Plugin developers can add to existing panels or groups or define entirely new panels as needed. For more details, see [Populating the Home Page](../development/homepage.md).

### Changed

#### Slug fields are now Optional in CSV import, REST API and ORM ([#493](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/493))

All models that have `slug` fields now use `AutoSlugField` from the `django-extensions` package. This means that when creating a record via the REST API, CSV import, or direct ORM Python calls, the `slug` field is now fully optional; if unspecified, it will be automatically assigned a unique value, just as how a `slug` is auto-populated in the UI when creating a new record.

Just as with the UI, the `slug` can still always be explicitly set if desired.
