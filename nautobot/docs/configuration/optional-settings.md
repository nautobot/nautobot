# Optional Configuration Settings

## Administratively Configurable Settings

+++ 1.2.0

A number of settings can alternatively be configured via the Nautobot Admin UI. To do so, these settings must **not** be defined in your `nautobot_config.py`, as any settings defined there will take precedence over any values defined in the Admin UI. Settings that are currently configurable via the Admin UI include:

* [BANNER_BOTTOM](#banner_bottom)
* [BANNER_LOGIN](#banner_login)
* [BANNER_TOP](#banner_top)
* [CHANGELOG_RETENTION](#changelog_retention)
* [HIDE_RESTRICTED_UI](#hide_restricted_ui)
* [MAX_PAGE_SIZE](#max_page_size)
* [PAGINATE_COUNT](#paginate_count)
* [PER_PAGE_DEFAULTS](#per_page_defaults)
* [PREFER_IPV4](#prefer_ipv4)
* [RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_HEIGHT](#rack_elevation_default_unit_height)
* [RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_WIDTH](#rack_elevation_default_unit_width)
* [RELEASE_CHECK_TIMEOUT](#release_check_timeout)
* [RELEASE_CHECK_URL](#release_check_url)

## Extra Applications

A need may arise to allow the user to register additional settings. These will automatically apply
based on keynames prefixed with `EXTRA_` assuming the base key (the latter part of the setting name) is
of type list or tuple.

For example, to register additional `INSTALLED_APPS`, you would simply specify this in your custom
(user) configuration::

```python
EXTRA_INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'foo.bar',
]
```

This will ensure your default setting's `INSTALLED_APPS` do not have to be modified, and the user
can specify additional apps with ease.  Similarly, additional `MIDDLEWARE` can be added using `EXTRA_MIDDLEWARE`.

## ALLOWED_URL_SCHEMES

Default: `('file', 'ftp', 'ftps', 'http', 'https', 'irc', 'mailto', 'sftp', 'ssh', 'tel', 'telnet', 'tftp', 'vnc', 'xmpp')`

A list of permitted URL schemes referenced when rendering links within Nautobot. Note that only the schemes specified in this list will be accepted: If adding your own, be sure to replicate all of the default values as well (excluding those schemes which are not desirable).

---

## BANNER_TOP

## BANNER_BOTTOM

Default: `""` (Empty string)

Setting these variables will display custom content in a banner at the top and/or bottom of the page, respectively. HTML is allowed. To replicate the content of the top banner in the bottom banner, set:

```python
BANNER_TOP = 'Your banner text'
BANNER_BOTTOM = BANNER_TOP
```

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for these settings in your `nautobot_config.py`, they can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for either setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## BANNER_LOGIN

Default: `""` (Empty string)

This defines custom content to be displayed on the login page above the login form. HTML is allowed.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## BRANDING_FILEPATHS

Default:

```python
{
    "logo": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_LOGO", None),  # Navbar logo
    "favicon": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_FAVICON", None),  # Browser favicon
    "icon_16": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_16", None),  # 16x16px icon
    "icon_32": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_32", None),  # 32x32px icon
    "icon_180": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_180", None),  # 180x180px icon - used for the apple-touch-icon header
    "icon_192": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_192", None),  # 192x192px icon
    "icon_mask": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_MASK", None),  # mono-chrome icon used for the mask-icon header
}
```

A set of filepaths relative to the [`MEDIA_ROOT`](#media_root) which locate image assets used for custom branding. Each of these assets takes the place of the corresponding stock Nautobot asset. This allows for instance, providing your own navbar logo and favicon.

These environment variables may be used to specify the values:

* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_LOGO`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_FAVICON`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_16`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_32`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_180`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_192`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_MASK`

If a custom image asset is not provided for any of the above options, the stock Nautobot asset is used.

---

## BRANDING_PREPENDED_FILENAME

+++ 1.3.4

Default: `"nautobot_"`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_PREPENDED_FILENAME`

Defines the prefix of the filename when exporting to CSV/YAML or export templates.

---

## BRANDING_TITLE

Default: `"Nautobot"`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_TITLE`

The defines the custom branding title that should be used in place of "Nautobot" within user facing areas of the application like the HTML title of web pages.

---

## BRANDING_URLS

Default:

```python
{
    "code": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_CODE", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot"),  # Code link in the footer
    "docs": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_DOCS", "<STATIC_URL>docs/index.html"),  # Docs link in the footer
    "help": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_HELP", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/wiki"),  # Help link in the footer
}
```

A set of URLs that correspond to helpful links in the right of the footer on every web page.

These environment variables may be used to specify the values:

* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_CODE`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_DOCS`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_HELP`

If a custom URL is not provided for any of the links, the default link within the Nautobot community is used.

---

## CACHEOPS_DEFAULTS

Default: `{'timeout': 900}` (15 minutes, in seconds)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CACHEOPS_TIMEOUT` (timeout value only)

!!! warning
    It is an error to set the timeout value to `0`. If you wish to disable caching, please use [`CACHEOPS_ENABLED`](#cacheops_enabled).

Various defaults for caching, the most important of which being the cache timeout. The `timeout` is the number of seconds that cache entries will be retained before expiring.

---

## CACHEOPS_ENABLED

Default: `True`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CACHEOPS_ENABLED`

A boolean that turns on/off caching.

If set to `False`, all caching is bypassed and Nautobot operates as if there is no cache.

---

## CACHEOPS_HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED

Default: `False`

A boolean that turns on/off health checks for the Redis server connection utilized by Cacheops. Most deployments share a Redis server with `django-redis` as such we only need to check the health of Redis one time.  If you are using a separate Redis deployment for Cacheops, please consider enabling this to monitor that Redis deployment.  Keep in mind the more health checks enabled the longer the health checks will take and timeouts might need to be increased.

---

## CELERY_BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS

Default: `{}`

A dict of additional options passed to the Celery broker transport. This is only required when [configuring Celery to utilize Redis Sentinel](../additional-features/caching.md#celery-sentinel-configuration).

---

## CELERY_BROKER_URL

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_BROKER_URL`

Default: `'redis://localhost:6379/0'`

Celery broker URL used to tell workers where queues are located.

---

## CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`

Default: `'redis://localhost:6379/0'`

Celery result backend used to tell workers where to store task results (tombstones).

---

## CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS

Default: `{}`

A dict of additional options passed to the Celery result backend transport. This is only required when [configuring Celery to utilize Redis Sentinel](../additional-features/caching.md#celery-sentinel-configuration).

---

## CELERY_TASK_SOFT_TIME_LIMIT

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_TASK_SOFT_TIME_LIMIT`

The global Celery task soft timeout (in seconds). Any background task that exceeds this duration will receive a `SoftTimeLimitExceeded` exception and is responsible for handling this exception and performing any necessary cleanup or final operations before ending. See also `CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT` below.

---

## CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT

Default: `600` (10 minutes)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT`

The global Celery task hard timeout (in seconds). Any background task that exceeds this duration will be forcibly killed with a `SIGKILL` signal.

---

## CHANGELOG_RETENTION

Default: `90`

The number of days to retain logged changes (object creations, updates, and deletions). Set this to `0` to retain changes in the database indefinitely.

!!! warning
    If enabling indefinite changelog retention, it is recommended to periodically delete old entries. Otherwise, the database may eventually exceed capacity.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS`

If `True`, all origins will be allowed. Other settings restricting allowed origins will be ignored.

Setting this to `True` can be dangerous, as it allows any website to make cross-origin requests to yours. Generally you'll want to restrict the list of allowed origins with [`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`](#cors_allowed_origins) or [`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES`](#cors_allowed_origin_regexes).

Previously this setting was called `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL`, which still works as an alias, with the new name taking precedence.

---

## CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

A list of origins that are authorized to make cross-site HTTP requests.

An Origin is defined by [the CORS RFC Section 3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2) as a URI `scheme + hostname + port`, or one of the special values `'null'` or `'file://'`. Default ports (HTTPS = 443, HTTP = 80) are optional here.

The special value `null` is sent by the browser in ["privacy-sensitive contexts"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-6), such as when the client is running from a `file://` domain. The special value `file://` is sent accidentally by some versions of Chrome on Android as per this bug.

Example:

```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "https://example.com",
    "https://sub.example.com",
    "http://localhost:8080",
    "http://127.0.0.1:9000"
]
```

Previously this setting was called `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST`, which still works as an alias, with the new name taking precedence.

---

## CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES

Default: `[]`

A list of strings representing regexes that match Origins that are authorized to make cross-site HTTP requests. Useful when [`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`](#cors_allowed_origins) is impractical, such as when you have a large number of subdomains.

Example:

```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
    r"^https://\w+\.example\.com$",
]
```

Previously this setting was called `CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX_WHITELIST`, which still works as an alias, with the new name taking precedence.

---

## DISABLE_PREFIX_LIST_HIERARCHY

Default: `False`

This setting disables rendering of the IP prefix hierarchy (parent/child relationships) in the IPAM prefix list view. With large sets of prefixes, users may encounter a performance penalty when trying to load the prefix list view due to the nature of calculating the parent/child relationships. This setting allows users to disable the hierarchy and instead only render a flat list of all prefixes in the table.

A later release of Nautobot will address the underlying performance issues, and likely remove this configuration option.

---

## ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE`

By default, Nautobot will permit users to create duplicate prefixes and IP addresses in the global table (that is, those which are not assigned to any VRF). This behavior can be disabled by setting `ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE` to `True`.

---

## EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

A list of Nautobot models to exempt from the enforcement of view permissions. Models listed here will be viewable by all users, both authenticated and anonymous.

List models in the form `<app>.<model>`. For example:

```python
EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS = [
    'dcim.site',
    'dcim.region',
    'ipam.prefix',
]
```

To exempt _all_ models from view permission enforcement, set the following. (Note that `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` must be an iterable.)

```python
EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS = ['*']
```

!!! note
    Using a wildcard will not affect certain potentially sensitive models, such as user permissions. If there is a need to exempt these models, they must be specified individually.

---

## EXTERNAL_AUTH_DEFAULT_GROUPS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

The list of group names to assign a new user account when created using 3rd-party authentication.

---

## EXTERNAL_AUTH_DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

A mapping of permissions to assign a new user account when created using SSO authentication. Each key in the dictionary will be the permission name specified as `<app_label>.<action>_<model>`, and the value should be set to the permission [constraints](../administration/permissions.md#constraints), or `None` to allow all objects.

### Example Permissions

| Permission | Description |
|---|---|
| `{'dcim.view_device': {}}` or `{'dcim.view_device': None}` | Users can view all devices |
| `{'dcim.add_device': {}}` | Users can add devices, see note below |
| `{'dcim.view_device': {"site__name__in":  ["HQ"]}}` | Users can view all devices in the HQ site |

!!! warning
    Permissions can be complicated! Be careful when restricting permissions to also add any required prerequisite permissions.

    For example, when adding Devices the Device Role, Device Type, Site, and Status fields are all required fields in order for the UI to function properly. Users will also need view permissions for those fields or the corresponding field selections in the UI will be unavailable and potentially prevent objects from being able to be created or edited.

The following example gives a user a reasonable amount of access to add devices to a single site (HQ in this case):

```python
{
    'dcim.add_device': {"site__name__in":  ["HQ"]},
    'dcim.view_device': {"site__name__in":  ["HQ"]},
    'dcim.view_devicerole': None,
    'dcim.view_devicetype': None,
    'extras.view_status': None,
    'dcim.view_site': {"name__in":  ["HQ"]},
    'dcim.view_manufacturer': None,
    'dcim.view_region': None,
    'dcim.view_rack': None,
    'dcim.view_rackgroup': None,
    'dcim.view_platform': None,
    'virtualization.view_cluster': None,
    'virtualization.view_clustergroup': None,
    'tenancy.view_tenant': None,
    'tenancy.view_tenantgroup': None,
}
```

Please see [the object permissions page](../administration/permissions.md) for more information.

---

## GIT_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "git")`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_GIT_ROOT`

The file path to a directory where cloned [Git repositories](../models/extras/gitrepository.md) will be located.

The value of this variable can also be customized by setting the environment variable `NAUTOBOT_GIT_ROOT` to a directory path of your choosing.

---

## GRAPHQL_COMPUTED_FIELD_PREFIX

Default: `"cpf"`

By default, all computed fields in GraphQL will be prefixed with `cf`. A computed field named `my_field` will appear in GraphQL as `cpf_my_field` by default. It's possible to change or remove the prefix by setting the value of `GRAPHQL_COMPUTED_FIELD_PREFIX`.

---

## GRAPHQL_CUSTOM_FIELD_PREFIX

Default: `"cf"`

By default, all custom fields in GraphQL will be prefixed with `cf`. A custom field named `my_field` will appear in GraphQL as `cf_my_field` by default. It's possible to change or remove the prefix by setting the value of `GRAPHQL_CUSTOM_FIELD_PREFIX`.

---

## GRAPHQL_RELATIONSHIP_PREFIX

Default: `"rel"`

By default, all relationship associations in GraphQL will be prefixed with `rel`. A relationship named `my_relationship` will appear in GraphQL as `rel_my_relationship` by default. It's possible to change or remove the prefix by setting the value of `GRAPHQL_RELATIONSHIP_PREFIX`.

---

## HIDE_RESTRICTED_UI

Default: `False`

When set to `True`, users with limited permissions will only be able to see items in the UI they have access to.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

+++ 1.3.10
    When this setting is set to `True`, logged out users will be redirected to the login page when navigating to the Nautobot home page.

---

## HTTP_PROXIES

Default: `None` (Disabled)

A dictionary of HTTP proxies to use for outbound requests originating from Nautobot (e.g. when sending webhook requests). Proxies should be specified by schema (HTTP and HTTPS) as per the [Python requests library documentation](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/). For example:

```python
HTTP_PROXIES = {
    'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',
    'https': 'http://10.10.1.10:1080',
}
```

!!! note
    When using Git repositories within Nautobot the Python library `GitPython` needs extra proxy configuration:

```bash
git config --global http.proxy http://192.0.2.1:3128
git config --global https.proxy http://192.0.2.1:3128
```

---

## JOBS_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "jobs")`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_JOBS_ROOT`

The file path to a directory where [Jobs](../additional-features/jobs.md) can be discovered.

!!! caution
    This directory **must** contain an `__init__.py` file.

---

## MAINTENANCE_MODE

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_MAINTENANCE_MODE`

Setting this to `True` will display a "maintenance mode" banner at the top of every page. Additionally, Nautobot will no longer update a user's "last active" time upon login. This is to allow new logins when the database is in a read-only state. Recording of login times will resume when maintenance mode is disabled.

!!! note
    The default [`SESSION_ENGINE`](#session_engine) configuration will store sessions in the database, this obviously will not work when `MAINTENANCE_MODE` is `True` and the database is in a read-only state for maintenance.  Consider setting `SESSION_ENGINE` to `django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache` when enabling `MAINTENANCE_MODE`.

!!! note
    The Docker container normally attempts to run migrations on startup; however, if the database is in a read-only state the Docker container will fail to start.  Setting the environment variable [`NAUTOBOT_DOCKER_SKIP_INIT`](../docker/index.md#nautobot_docker_skip_init) to `true` will prevent the migrations from occurring.

!!! note
    If you are using `django-auth-ldap` for LDAP authentication, `django-auth-ldap` by default will try to update a user object on every log in.  If the database is in a read-only state `django-auth-ldap` will fail.  You will also need to set `AUTH_LDAP_ALWAYS_UPDATE_USER=False` and `AUTH_LDAP_NO_NEW_USERS=True` to avoid this, please see the [`django-auth-ldap` documentation](https://django-auth-ldap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html) for more information.

---

## MAX_PAGE_SIZE

Default: `1000`

A web user or API consumer can request an arbitrary number of objects by appending the "limit" parameter to the URL (e.g. `?limit=1000`). This parameter defines the maximum acceptable limit. Setting this to `0` or `None` will allow a client to retrieve _all_ matching objects at once with no limit by specifying `?limit=0`.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## METRICS_ENABLED

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_METRICS_ENABLED`

Toggle the availability Prometheus-compatible metrics at `/metrics`. See the [Prometheus Metrics](../additional-features/prometheus-metrics.md) documentation for more details.

---

## NAPALM_USERNAME

## NAPALM_PASSWORD

Default: `""` (Empty string)

Environment Variables: `NAUTOBOT_NAPALM_USERNAME` and `NAUTOBOT_NAPALM_PASSWORD`

Nautobot will use these credentials when authenticating to remote devices via the [NAPALM library](https://napalm.readthedocs.io), if installed. Both parameters are optional.

!!! note
    If SSH public key authentication has been set up on the remote device(s) for the system account under which Nautobot runs, these parameters are not needed.

!!! note
    If a given device has an appropriately populated [secrets group](../models/extras/secretsgroup.md) assigned to it, the [secrets](../models/extras/secret.md) defined in that group will take precedence over these default values.

---

## NAPALM_ARGS

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

A dictionary of optional arguments to pass to NAPALM when instantiating a network driver. See the NAPALM documentation for a [complete list of optional arguments](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/#optional-arguments). An example:

```python
NAPALM_ARGS = {
    'api_key': '472071a93b60a1bd1fafb401d9f8ef41',
    'port': 2222,
}
```

Some platforms (e.g. Cisco IOS) require an enable password to be passed in addition to the normal password. If desired, you can use the configured `NAPALM_PASSWORD` as the value for this argument:

```python
NAPALM_USERNAME = 'username'
NAPALM_PASSWORD = 'MySecretPassword'
NAPALM_ARGS = {
    'secret': NAPALM_PASSWORD,          # ios and nxos_ssh
    'enable_password': NAPALM_PASSWORD, # eos
    # Include any additional args here
}
```

!!! note
    If a given device has an appropriately populated [secrets group](../models/extras/secretsgroup.md) assigned to it, a [secret](../models/extras/secret.md) defined in that group can override the `NAPALM_ARGS["secret"]` or `NAPALM_ARGS["enable_password"]` default value defined here.

---

## NAPALM_TIMEOUT

Default: `30`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_NAPALM_TIMEOUT`

The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for NAPALM to connect to a device.

---

## PAGINATE_COUNT

Default: `50`

The default maximum number of objects to display per page within each list of objects. Applies to both the UI and the REST API.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## PER_PAGE_DEFAULTS

Default: `[25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]`

The options displayed in the web interface dropdown to limit the number of objects per page. For proper user experience, this list should include the [`PAGINATE_COUNT`](#paginate_count) and [`MAX_PAGE_SIZE`](#max_page_size) values as options.

---

## PLUGINS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

A list of installed [Nautobot plugins](../plugins/index.md) to enable. Plugins will not take effect unless they are listed here.

!!! warning
    Plugins extend Nautobot by allowing external code to run with the same access and privileges as Nautobot itself. Only install plugins from trusted sources. The Nautobot maintainers make absolutely no guarantees about the integrity or security of your installation with plugins enabled.

---

## PLUGINS_CONFIG

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

This parameter holds configuration settings for individual Nautobot plugins. It is defined as a dictionary, with each key using the name of an installed plugin. The specific parameters supported are unique to each plugin: Reference the plugin's documentation to determine the supported parameters. An example configuration is shown below:

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    'plugin1': {
        'foo': 123,
        'bar': True
    },
    'plugin2': {
        'foo': 456,
    },
}
```

Note that a plugin must be listed in `PLUGINS` for its configuration to take effect.

---

## PREFER_IPV4

Default: `False`

When determining the primary IP address for a device, IPv6 is preferred over IPv4 by default. Set this to True to prefer IPv4 instead.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_HEIGHT

Default: `22`

Default height (in pixels) of a unit within a rack elevation. For best results, this should be approximately one tenth of `RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_WIDTH`.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_WIDTH

Default: `220`

Default width (in pixels) of a unit within a rack elevation.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## REDIS_LOCK_TIMEOUT

Default: `600`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_REDIS_LOCK_TIMEOUT`

Maximum duration of a Redis lock created when calling `/api/ipam/prefixes/{id}/available-prefixes/` or `/api/ipam/prefixes/{id}/available-ips/` to avoid inadvertently allocating the same prefix or IP to multiple simultaneous callers. Default is set to 600 seconds (10 minutes) to be longer than any theoretical API call time. This is to prevent a deadlock scenario where the server did not gracefully exit the `with` block when acquiring the Redis lock.

---

## RELEASE_CHECK_TIMEOUT

Default: `86400` (24 hours)

The number of seconds to retain the latest version that is fetched from the GitHub API before automatically invalidating it and fetching it from the API again.

!!! warning
    This must be set to at least one hour (`3600` seconds). Setting it to a value lower than this is an error.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## RELEASE_CHECK_URL

Default: `None` (disabled)

This parameter defines the URL of the repository that will be checked periodically for new Nautobot releases. When a new release is detected, a message will be displayed to administrative users on the home page. This can be set to the official repository (`'https://api.github.com/repos/nautobot/nautobot/releases'`) or a custom fork. Set this to `None` to disable automatic update checks.

!!! note
    The URL provided **must** be compatible with the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## SANITIZER_PATTERNS

+++ 1.3.4

Default:

```python
[
    (re.compile(r"(https?://)?\S+\s*@", re.IGNORECASE), r"\1{replacement}@"),
    (re.compile(r"(username|password|passwd|pwd)(\s*i?s?\s*:?\s*)?\S+", re.IGNORECASE), r"\1\2{replacement}"),
]
```

List of (regular expression, replacement pattern) tuples used by the `nautobot.utilities.logging.sanitize()` function. As of Nautobot 1.3.4 this function is used primarily for sanitization of Job log entries, but it may be used in other scopes in the future.

---

## STORAGE_BACKEND

Default: `None` (local storage)

The backend storage engine for handling uploaded files (e.g. image attachments). Nautobot supports integration with the [`django-storages`](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package, which provides backends for several popular file storage services. If not configured, local filesystem storage will be used.

The configuration parameters for the specified storage backend are defined under the [`STORAGE_CONFIG`](#storage_config) setting.

---

## STORAGE_CONFIG

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

A dictionary of configuration parameters for the storage backend configured as [`STORAGE_BACKEND`](#storage_backend). The specific parameters to be used here are specific to each backend; see the [`django-storages` documentation](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more detail.

If [`STORAGE_BACKEND`](#storage_backend) is not defined, this setting will be ignored.

---

## STRICT_FILTERING

+++ 1.4.0

Default: `True`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_STRICT_FILTERING`

If set to `True` (default), UI and REST API filtering of object lists will fail if an unknown/unrecognized filter parameter is provided as a URL parameter. (For example, `/dcim/devices/?ice_cream_flavor=chocolate` or `/api/dcim/sites/?ice_cream_flavor=chocolate`). UI list (table) views will report an error message in this case and display no filtered objects; REST API list endpoints will return a 400 Bad Request response with an explanatory error message.

If set to `False`, unknown/unrecognized filter parameters will be discarded and ignored, although Nautobot will log a warning message.

!!! warning
    Setting this to `False` can result in unexpected filtering results in the case of user error, for example `/dcim/devices/?has_primry_ip=false` (note the typo `primry`) will result in a list of all devices, rather than the intended list of only devices that lack a primary IP address. In the case of Jobs or external automation making use of such a filter, this could have wide-ranging consequences.

---

## UI_RACK_VIEW_TRUNCATE_FUNCTION

+++ 1.4.0

Default:

```py
def UI_RACK_VIEW_TRUNCATE_FUNCTION(device_display_name):
    return str(device_display_name).split(".")[0]
```

This setting function is used to perform the rack elevation truncation feature. This provides a way to tailor the truncation behavior to best suit the needs of the installation.

The function must take only one argument: the device display name, as a string, attempting to be rendered on the rack elevation.

The function must return only one argument: a string of the truncated device display name.

## Environment-Variable-Only Settings

!!! warning
    The following settings are **only** configurable as environment variables, and not via `nautobot_config.py` or similar.

---

### GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY

Default: Unset

If you are using a self-signed git repository, you will need to set the environment variable `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY="1"`
in order for the repository to sync.

!!! warning
    This _must_ be specified as an environment variable. Setting it in `nautobot_config.py` will not have the desired effect.

---

### NAUTOBOT_ROOT

Default: `~/.nautobot/`

The filesystem path to use to store Nautobot files (Jobs, uploaded images, Git repositories, etc.).

This setting is used internally in the core settings to provide default locations for [features that require file storage](index.md#file-storage), and the [default location of the `nautobot_config.py`](index.md#specifying-your-configuration).

!!! warning
    Do not override `NAUTOBOT_ROOT` in your `nautobot_config.py`. It will not work as expected. If you need to customize this setting, please always set the `NAUTOBOT_ROOT` environment variable.

## Django Configuration Settings

While the [official Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/) documents all Django settings, the below is provided where either the setting is common in Nautobot deployments and/or there is a supported `NAUTOBOT_*` environment variable.

### ADMINS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

Nautobot will email details about critical errors to the administrators listed here. This should be a list of (name, email) tuples. For example:

```python
ADMINS = [
    ['Hank Hill', 'hhill@example.com'],
    ['Dale Gribble', 'dgribble@example.com'],
]
```

Please see the [official Django documentation on `ADMINS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#admins) for more information.

---

### CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS

Default: `[]`

A list of hosts (fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) or subdomains) that are considered trusted origins for cross-site secure requests such as HTTPS POST.

For more information, please see the [official Django documentation on `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#csrf-trusted-origins) and more generally the [official Django documentation on CSRF protection](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/csrf/#how-it-works)

---

### Date and Time Formatting

You may define custom formatting for date and times. For detailed instructions on writing format strings, please see [the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/builtins/#date). Default formats are listed below.

```python
DATE_FORMAT = 'N j, Y'               # June 26, 2016
SHORT_DATE_FORMAT = 'Y-m-d'          # 2016-06-26
TIME_FORMAT = 'g:i a'                # 1:23 p.m.
DATETIME_FORMAT = 'N j, Y g:i a'     # June 26, 2016 1:23 p.m.
SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT = 'Y-m-d H:i'  # 2016-06-26 13:23
```

Environment Variables:

* `NAUTOBOT_DATE_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_SHORT_DATE_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_TIME_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_SHORT_TIME_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_DATETIME_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT`

---

### DEBUG

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_DEBUG`

This setting enables debugging. Debugging should be enabled only during development or troubleshooting. Note that only
clients which access Nautobot from a recognized [internal IP address](#internal_ips) will see debugging tools in the user interface.

!!! warning
    Never enable debugging on a production system, as it can expose sensitive data to unauthenticated users and impose a
    substantial performance penalty.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `DEBUG`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#debug) for more information.

---

### FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME

Default: `None`

If not `None`, this will be used as the value of the `SCRIPT_NAME` environment variable in any HTTP request. This setting can be used to override the server-provided value of `SCRIPT_NAME`, which is most commonly used for hosting Nautobot in a subdirectory (e.g. _example.com/nautobot/_).

!!! important
    To host Nautobot under a subdirectory you must set this value to match the same prefix configured on your HTTP server. For example, if you configure NGINX to serve Nautobot at `/nautobot/`, you must set `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = "/nautobot/"`.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#force-script-name) for more information.

---

### INTERNAL_IPS

Default: `('127.0.0.1', '::1')`

A list of IP addresses recognized as internal to the system, used to control the display of debugging output. For
example, the [Django debugging toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/), if installed,
will be viewable only when a client is accessing Nautobot from one of the listed IP
addresses (and [`DEBUG`](#debug) is true).

---

### LOGGING

Default:

```python
{
    "version": 1,
    "disable_existing_loggers": False,
    "formatters": {
        "normal": {
            "format": "%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(levelname)-7s %(name)s :\n  %(message)s",
            "datefmt": "%H:%M:%S",
        },
        "verbose": {
            "format": "%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(levelname)-7s %(name)-20s %(filename)-15s %(funcName)30s() :\n  %(message)s",
            "datefmt": "%H:%M:%S",
        },
    },
    "handlers": {
        "normal_console": {
            "level": "INFO",
            "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
            "formatter": "normal",
        },
        "verbose_console": {
            "level": "DEBUG",
            "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
            "formatter": "verbose",
        },
    },
    "loggers": {
        "django": {"handlers": ["normal_console"], "level": "INFO"},
        "nautobot": {
            "handlers": ["verbose_console" if DEBUG else "normal_console"],
            "level": LOG_LEVEL,
        },
    },
}
```

This translates to:

* all messages from Django and from Nautobot of INFO severity or higher will be logged to the console.
* if [`DEBUG`](#debug) is True, Nautobot DEBUG messages will also be logged, and all Nautobot messages will be logged with a more verbose format including the filename and function name that originated each log message.

The above default log formatters split each log message across two lines of output for greater readability, which is useful for local observation and troubleshooting, but you may find it impractical to use in production environments that expect one line per log message. Fortunately, the Django framework on which Nautobot runs allows for extensive customization of logging format and destination. Please consult the [Django logging documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/logging/) for more information on configuring this setting.

Below is an example configuration extension which will additionally write all INFO and higher messages to a local file:

```python
LOGGING["handlers"]["file"] = {
    "level": "INFO",
    "class": "logging.FileHandler",
    "filename": "/var/log/nautobot.log",
    "formatter": "normal",
}
LOGGING["loggers"]["django"]["handlers"] += ["file"]
LOGGING["loggers"]["nautobot"]["handlers"] += ["file"]
```

Additional examples are available in the [`/examples/logging`](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/tree/develop/examples/logging) directory in the Nautobot repository.

#### Available Loggers

* `django.*` - Generic Django operations (HTTP requests/responses, etc.)
* `nautobot.<app>.<module>` - Generic form for model- or module-specific log messages
* `nautobot.auth.*` - Authentication events
* `nautobot.jobs.*` - Job execution (`* = JobClassName`)
* `nautobot.graphql.*` - [GraphQL](../additional-features/graphql.md) initialization and operation.
* `nautobot.plugins.*` - Plugin loading and activity
* `nautobot.views.*` - Views which handle business logic for the web UI

---

### MEDIA_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "media")`

The file path to the location where media files (such as [image attachments](../models/extras/imageattachment.md)) are stored.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `MEDIA_ROOT`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#media-root) for more information.

---

### SESSION_COOKIE_AGE

Default: `1209600` (2 weeks, in seconds)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`

The age of session cookies, in seconds.

---

### SESSION_ENGINE

Default: `'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db'`

Controls where Nautobot stores session data.

To use cache-based sessions, set this to `'django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache'`.
To use file-based sessions, set this to `'django.contrib.sessions.backends.file'`.

See the official Django documentation on [Configuring the session](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/sessions/#configuring-sessions) engine for more details.

---

### SESSION_FILE_PATH

Default: `None`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_SESSION_FILE_PATH`

HTTP session data is used to track authenticated users when they access Nautobot. By default, Nautobot stores session data in its database. However, this inhibits authentication to a standby instance of Nautobot without write access to the database. Alternatively, a local file path may be specified here and Nautobot will store session data as files instead of using the database. Note that the Nautobot system user must have read and write permissions to this path.

When the default value (`None`) is used, Nautobot will use the standard temporary directory for the system.

If you set this value, you must also enable file-based sessions as explained above using [`SESSION_ENGINE`](#session_engine).

---

### STATIC_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "static")`

The location where static files (such as CSS, JavaScript, fonts, or images) used to serve the web interface will be staged by the `nautobot-server collectstatic` command.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `STATIC_ROOT`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#std:setting-STATIC_ROOT) for more information.

---

### TIME_ZONE

Default: `"UTC"`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_TIME_ZONE`

The time zone Nautobot will use when dealing with dates and times. It is recommended to use UTC time unless you have a specific need to use a local time zone. Please see the [list of available time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

Please see the [official Django documentation on `TIME_ZONE`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#time-zone) for more information.
