# NAPALM

Nautobot supports integration with the [NAPALM automation](https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm/) library. NAPALM allows Nautobot to serve a proxy for operational data, fetching live data from network devices and returning it to a requester via its REST API. Note that Nautobot does not store any NAPALM data locally.

!!! note
    To enable this integration, the NAPALM library must be installed. See [installation steps](../installation/nautobot.md#configuring-napalm) for more information.

Below is an example REST API request and response:

```no-highlight
GET /api/dcim/devices/1/napalm/?method=get_environment

{
    "get_environment": {
        ...
    }
}
```

!!! note
    To make NAPALM requests via the Nautobot REST API, a Nautobot user must have assigned a permission granting the `napalm_read` action for the device object type.

## Authentication

As of Nautobot 1.2, there are three ways to specify the authentication credentials to use for a given device:

1. `NAPALM_USERNAME` and `NAPALM_PASSWORD` configuration parameters, setting global defaults to use for all devices.
2. Assigning an appropriately defined [secrets group](../models/extras/secretsgroup.md) to the device to specify its specific credentials.
3. In a REST API call, specifying the credentials as HTTP headers.

### Configuration Parameters

By default, the [`NAPALM_USERNAME`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#napalm_username) and [`NAPALM_PASSWORD`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#napalm_password) configuration parameters are used for NAPALM authentication.

### Secrets Groups

If a given device has an associated secrets group, and that secrets group contains [secrets](../models/extras/secret.md) assigned as *access type* `Generic` and *secrets types* `Username` and `Password` (and optionally an additional `Secret` entry as well, which will be used for a Cisco enable secret as needed), these credentials will be used for NAPALM authentication, overriding any global defaults specified in `nautobot_config.py`.

Note that in the case where many devices in your network share common credentials (such as a standardized service account), it's straightforward to define an appropriate secrets group and then use the device "bulk editing" functionality in Nautobot to quickly assign this group to a collection of devices.

### REST API HTTP Headers

The NAPALM credentials specified by either of the above methods can be overridden for an individual REST API call by specifying the `X-NAPALM-Username` and `X-NAPALM-Password` headers.

```bash
$ curl "http://localhost/api/dcim/devices/1/napalm/?method=get_environment" \
-H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json; indent=4" \
-H "X-NAPALM-Username: foo" \
-H "X-NAPALM-Password: bar"
```

## Method Support

The list of supported NAPALM methods depends on the [NAPALM driver](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#general-support-matrix) configured for the platform of a device. Because there is no granular mechanism in place for limiting potentially disruptive requests, Nautobot supports only read-only [get](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#getters-support-matrix) methods.

## Multiple Methods

It is possible to request the output of multiple NAPALM methods in a single API request by passing multiple `method` parameters. For example:

```no-highlight
GET /api/dcim/devices/1/napalm/?method=get_ntp_servers&method=get_ntp_peers

{
    "get_ntp_servers": {
        ...
    },
    "get_ntp_peers": {
        ...
    }
}
```

## Optional Arguments

The behavior of NAPALM drivers can be adjusted according to the [optional arguments](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#optional-arguments). Nautobot exposes those arguments using headers prefixed with `X-NAPALM-`. For example, the SSH port is changed to 2222 in this API call:

```bash
$ curl "http://localhost/api/dcim/devices/1/napalm/?method=get_environment" \
-H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json; indent=4" \
-H "X-NAPALM-port: 2222"
```
