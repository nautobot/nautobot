## What is Nautobot?

Nautobot is an open source Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application atop the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Python framework with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) database.

## Key Use Cases

Nautobot enables three (3) key use cases.

1. **Flexible Source of Truth for Networking** — Nautobot serves as a highly flexible source of truth for network infrastructure, utilizing its core data models to define the intended state of your network. While it provides a baseline set of models such as IP networks, devices, racks, circuits, and cables, Nautobot's true strength lies in its flexibility. Users can define custom relationships and fields for any model, ensuring that the platform adapts to their specific needs. Additionally, Nautobot's robust data validation allows for the enforcement of naming standards and the execution of automated tests before data is committed, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

2. **Extensible Data Platform for Automation** — Nautobot is designed to seamlessly integrate with network automation solutions, offering a comprehensive feature set that includes GraphQL, native Git integration, REST APIs, and webhooks. The Git integration allows Nautobot to dynamically load YAML data files as configuration contexts. The evolving App system further enhances Nautobot's capabilities, enabling users to create custom models, APIs, and UI elements. By unifying and aggregating disparate data sources, Nautobot provides a single source of truth, simplifying data management and streamlining network automation processes.

3. **Platform for Network Automation Apps** — The Nautobot App system empowers users to develop custom Network Automation Apps tailored to their specific needs. Whether lightweight or complex, these apps benefit from Nautobot's existing features such as authentication, permissions, webhooks, GraphQL, and change logging, significantly reducing development time by up to 70%. This integration not only accelerates the development process but also leverages the extensive data already stored in Nautobot, providing a powerful and efficient platform for building network automation solutions.
