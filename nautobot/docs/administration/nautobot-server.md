# The Nautobot Server Command

Nautobot includes a command-line (CLI) management utility called `nautobot-server`, that is used as a single entrypoint for common administrative tasks.

## Background

For those familiar with Django applications, this CLI utility works exactly as a project's `manage.py` script would, except that it comes bundled with the Nautobot code and therefore it gets automatically installed in the `bin` directory of your application environment.

!!! important
    Since Nautobot is a Django application, there are a number of built-in management commands that will not be covered in this document. Please see the [official Django documentation on management commands](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#available-commands) for more information.

!!! important
    Django does not recognize `nautobot-server`. Anywhere `python manage.py` is mentioned, it is safe to replace with `nautobot-server`.

## Getting Help

To see all available management commands as the Nautobot user:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server help
```

All management commands have a `-h/--help` flag to list all available arguments for that command, for example:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server migrate --help
```

## Available Commands

### `celery`

`nautobot-server celery`

Celery command entrypoint which serves as a thin wrapper to the `celery` command that includes the Nautobot Celery application context. This allows us to execute Celery commands without having to worry about the chicken-and-egg problem with bootstrapping the Django settings.

Most commonly you will be using this command to start the Celery worker process:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server celery worker --loglevel INFO --pidfile $(pwd)/nautobot-celery.pid -n worker1
```

Output:

```no-highlight
celery@worker1 v5.1.1 (sun-harmonics)

[config]
.> app:         nautobot:0x10c357eb0
.> transport:   redis://localhost:6379/0
.> results:     redis://localhost:6379/0
.> concurrency: 8 (prefork)
.> task events: OFF (enable -E to monitor tasks in this worker)

[queues]
.> celery           exchange=celery(direct) key=celery


[tasks]
  . nautobot.extras.datasources.git.pull_git_repository_and_refresh_data
  . nautobot.extras.jobs.run_job
  . nautobot.extras.tasks.delete_custom_field_data
  . nautobot.extras.tasks.process_webhook
  . nautobot.extras.tasks.provision_field
  . nautobot.extras.tasks.update_custom_field_choice_data
  . nautobot.utilities.tasks.get_releases

[2021-07-01 21:32:40,680: INFO/MainProcess] Connected to redis://localhost:6379/0

[2021-07-01 21:32:41,730: INFO/MainProcess] celery@worker1 ready.
```

!!! note
    The internals of this command are built into Celery. Please see the [official Celery workers guide](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/workers.html) for more information.

### `collectstatic`

`nautobot-server collectstatic`

Collect static files into [`STATIC_ROOT`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#static_root).

```no-highlight
nautobot-server collectstatic
```

Output:

```no-highlight
965 static files copied to '/opt/nautobot/static'.
```

!!! note
    This is a built-in Django command. Please see the [official documentation on `collectstatic`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#collectstatic) for more information.

### `createsuperuser`

`nautobot-server createsuperuser`

Creates a superuser account that has all permissions.

```no-highlight
nautobot-server createsuperuser
```

This provides the following output:

```no-highlight
Username (leave blank to use 'jathan'): example
Email address: example@localhost
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.
```

!!! note
    This is a built-in Django command. Please see the [official documentation on `createsuperuser`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#createsuperuser) for more information.

### `dbshell`

`nautobot-server dbshell`

A shell for your database. This can be very useful in troubleshooting raw database issues.

!!! danger
    This is an advanced feature that gives you direct access to run raw SQL queries. Use this very cautiously as you can cause irreparable damage to your Nautobot installation.

```no-highlight
nautobot-server dbshell
```

Output:

```no-highlight
psql (12.6 (Ubuntu 12.6-0ubuntu0.20.04.1))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

nautobot=> \conninfo
You are connected to database "nautobot" as user "nautobot" on host "localhost" (address "::1") at port "5432".
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
nautobot=> \q
```

!!! note
    This is a built-in Django command. Please see the [official documentation on `dbshell`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#dbshell) for more information.

### `dumpdata`

+/- 1.3.0
    - `extras.job` should now be included in the dump (removed `--exclude extras.job` from the example usage)
    - `django_rq` should now be excluded from the dump (added `--exclude django_rq` to the example usage)

+/- 1.5.23
    - We do not recommend at this time using `--natural-primary` as this can result in inconsistent or incorrect data for data models that use GenericForeignKeys, such as `Cable`, `Note`, `ObjectChange`, and `Tag`.
    - We also do not recommend at this time using `--natural-foreign` as it can potentially result in errors if any data models incorrectly implement their `natural_key()` and/or `get_by_natural_key()` API methods.
    - `contenttypes` must not be excluded from the dump (it could be excluded previously due to the use of `--natural-foreign`).

```no-highlight
nautobot-server dumpdata \
  --exclude auth.permission \
  --exclude django_rq \
  --format json \
  --indent 2 \
  --traceback \
  > nautobot_dump.json
```

Use this command to generate a JSON dump of the database contents.

One example of using this command would be to [export data from PostgreSQL](../installation/migrating-from-postgresql.md#export-data-from-postgresql) and then [import the data dump into MySQL](../installation/migrating-from-postgresql.md#import-the-database-dump-into-mysql).

### `fix_custom_fields`

`nautobot-server fix_custom_fields`

Adds/Removes any custom fields which should or should not exist on an object. This command should not be run unless a custom fields jobs has failed:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server fix_custom_fields
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
Processing ContentType dcim | device
Processing ContentType dcim | site
Processing ContentType dcim | rack
Processing ContentType dcim | cable
Processing ContentType dcim | power feed
Processing ContentType circuits | circuit
Processing ContentType ipam | prefix
... (truncated for brevity of documentation) ...
```

### `generate_secret_key`

`nautobot-server generate_secret_key`

Generates a new [`SECRET_KEY`](../configuration/required-settings.md#secret_key) that can be used in your `nautobot_config.py`:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server generate_secret_key
```

Output:

```no-highlight
e!j=vrlhz-!wl8p_3+q5s5cph29nzj$xm81eap-!&n!_9^du09
```

### `generate_test_data`

+++ 1.5.0

`nautobot-server generate_test_data [--flush] --seed SEED`

Populate the database with various data as a baseline for testing (automated or manual).

`--flush`  
Flush any existing data from the database before generating new data.

!!! danger
    Running this command with the `--flush` argument will clear all existing data in your database. You have been warned.

`--seed SEED`  
String to use as a random generator seed for reproducible results.

```no-highlight
nautobot-server generate_test_data --flush --seed "Nautobot"
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight
Flushing all existing data from the database...
Seeding the pseudo-random number generator with seed "Nautobot"...
Creating Statuses...
Creating TenantGroups...
Creating Tenants...
Creating RIRs...
Creating Aggregates...
Creating RouteTargets...
Creating VRFs...
Creating IP/VLAN Roles...
Creating VLANGroups...
Creating VLANs...
Database populated successfully!
```

### `health_check`

`nautobot-server health_check`

Run health checks and exit 0 if everything went well.

```no-highlight
nautobot-server health_check
```

Output

```no-highlight
DatabaseBackend          ... working
DefaultFileStorageHealthCheck ... working
RedisBackend             ... working
```

Please see the [healthcheck documentation](../additional-features/healthcheck.md) for more information.

### `init`

`nautobot-server init [--disable-installation-metrics] [config_path]`

Generates a new configuration with all of the default settings provided for you, and will also generate a unique[`SECRET_KEY`](../configuration/required-settings.md#secret_key).

By default the file will be created at `$HOME/.nautobot/nautobot_config.py`:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server init
```

Output:

```no-highlight
Nautobot would like to send anonymized installation metrics to the project's maintainers.
These metrics include the installed Nautobot version, the Python version in use, an anonymous "deployment ID", and a list of one-way-hashed names of enabled Nautobot Apps and their versions.
Allow Nautobot to send these metrics? [y/n]: y
Installation metrics will be sent when running 'nautobot-server post_upgrade'. Thank you!
Configuration file created at /home/example/.nautobot/nautobot_config.py
```

+++ 1.6.0
    The `nautobot-server init` command will now prompt you to set the initial value for the [`INSTALLATION_METRICS_ENABLED`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#installation_metrics_enabled) setting. See the [send_installation_metrics](#send_installation_metrics) command for more information about the feature that this setting toggles.

For more information on configuring Nautobot for the first time or on more advanced configuration patterns, please see the guide on [Nautobot Configuration](../configuration/index.md).

### `invalidate`

`nautobot-server invalidate`

Invalidates cache for entire app, model or particular instance. Most commonly you will see us recommend clearing the entire cache using `invalidate all`:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server invalidate all
```

There are a number of other options not covered here.

!!! note
    This is a built-in management command provided by the [Cacheops plugin](https://github.com/Suor/django-cacheops) Nautobot for caching. Please see the official [Cacheops documentation on `invalidate`](https://github.com/Suor/django-cacheops#invalidation) for more information.

### `loaddata`

`nautobot-server loaddata --traceback nautobot_dump.json`

To import the data that was exported with `nautobot-server dumpdata ...` see the following documentation:

- [Remove auto-populated records from the database](../installation/migrating-from-postgresql.md#remove-auto-populated-records-from-the-mysql-database)
- [Import the database dump](../installation/migrating-from-postgresql.md#import-the-database-dump-into-mysql)
- [Rebuild cached cable path traces](../installation/migrating-from-postgresql.md#rebuild-cached-cable-path-traces)

### `migrate`

`nautobot-server migrate [app_label] [migration_name]`

Initialize a new database or run any pending database migrations to an existing database.

```no-highlight
nautobot-server migrate
```

Output:

```no-highlight
Wrapping model clean methods for custom validators failed because the ContentType table was not available or populated. This is normal during the execution of the migration command for the first time.
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, circuits, contenttypes, dcim, extras, ipam, sessions, taggit, tenancy, users, virtualization
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
... (truncated for brevity of documentation) ...
```

!!! note
    This is a built-in Django command. Please see the [official documentation on `migrate`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#migrate) for more information.

### `nbshell`

`nautobot-server nbshell`

An interactive Python shell with all of the database models and various other utilities already imported for you. This is immensely useful for direct access to manipulating database objects.

!!! danger
    This is an advanced feature that gives you direct access to the Django database models. Use this very cautiously as you can cause irreparable damage to your Nautobot installation.

```no-highlight
nautobot-server nbshell
```

Prompt provided:

```no-highlight
### Nautobot interactive shell (localhost)
### Python 3.11.4 | Django 3.2.20 | Nautobot 1.6.0
### lsmodels() will show available models. Use help(<model>) for more info.
>>>
```

Please see the dedicated guide on the [Nautobot Shell](nautobot-shell.md) for more information.

### `populate_platform_network_driver`

+++ 1.6.2

`nautobot-server populate_platform_network_driver`

This is a convenience command to populate the `network_driver` field on the `Platform` model. This is useful for users who have upgraded from Nautobot 1.5.x to 1.6.x and have not yet populated the `network_driver` field on the `Platform` model. By default, this command will attempt to map the `Platform.napalm_driver` field to a matching `network_driver` value through the `netutils.lib_mapper.NAPALM_LIB_MAPPER` mapping. If no match is found, the value of the `Platform.slug` field will be used as the `network_driver` instead. These behaviors can be modified through the `--no-use-slug-field` and `--no-use-napalm-driver-field` arguments. If the `--interactive` argument is provided, the user will be prompted to confirm each change. By default, the `network_driver` field will only be populated if it is currently empty. Use `--force` to overwrite existing values.

!!! important
    The `Platform.slug` field will be removed in Nautobot v2.0. We recommend populating the `network_driver` field with the appropriate value before upgrading to v2.0 or higher if you're using any Nautobot apps or jobs that connect to devices.

!!! note
    Some Nautobot apps (eg: Device Onboarding and Golden Config) require the `Platform.slug` to be set to the netmiko driver name in Nautobot v1.X. If you are using these apps, you should inspect your platforms' `slug` and `napalm_driver` fields to determine whether the `--no-use-slug-field` and `--no-use-napalm-driver-field` arguments should be used in your environment.

```no-highlight
nautobot-server populate_platform_network_driver [--no-use-slug-field | --no-use-napalm-driver-field] [--interactive]
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
Checking Aruba Platform 19...
Set "Aruba Platform 19" network_driver to "aruba-platform-19".
Checking Aruba Platform 5...
Set "Aruba Platform 5" network_driver to "aruba-platform-5".
Checking Cisco Platform 1...
Set "Cisco Platform 1" network_driver to "cisco_xr".
Checking Cisco Platform 7...
Set "Cisco Platform 7" network_driver to "cisco_nxos".
Checking Citrix Platform 3...
```

### `pre_migrate`

+++ 1.5.23

`nautobot-server pre_migrate`

+/- 1.6.3
    Added permission constraint checks to the list of pre-migration checks.

Performs pre-migration validation checks for Nautobot 2.0.

If the Nautobot 1.X instance cannot be upgraded, this command will exit uncleanly making it suitable for use in continuous integration workflows.

For example, if any of the pre-migration checks fail, you may see an error message like this:

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server pre_migrate
>>> Running check: check_configcontext_uniqueness...
>>> Running check: check_exporttemplate_uniqueness...
>>> Running check: check_virtualchassis_uniqueness...
CommandError: One or more pre-migration checks failed:
    You cannot migrate ConfigContext or ConfigContextSchema objects that have non-unique names:
    - ConfigContext: [{'name': 'cc1', 'count': 2}]
    - ConfigContextSchema: [{'name': 'ccs1', 'count': 2}]

    You cannot migrate VirtualChassis objects with non-unique names:
     - [{'name': 'vc1', 'count': 2}]
```

Otherwise, a clean exit displays "All pre-migration checks passed." incidating that your Nautobot instance is ready to be upgraded to Nautobot 2.0:

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server pre_migrate
>>> Running check: check_configcontext_uniqueness...
>>> Running check: check_exporttemplate_uniqueness...
>>> Running check: check_virtualchassis_uniqueness...
All pre-migration checks passed.
```

This command also emits messages to help identify permissions that may need to be manually updated. These messages are informational and will not cause the command to exit uncleanly.

### `post_upgrade`

`nautobot-server post_upgrade`

Performs common server post-upgrade operations using a single entrypoint.

This will run the following management commands with default settings, in order:

+/- 1.6.0
    Added the [`send_installation_metrics`](#send_installation_metrics) command to the list of commands run by `post_upgrade`.

- `migrate`
- `trace_paths`
- `collectstatic`
- `remove_stale_contenttypes`
- `clearsessions`
- `invalidate all`
- `send_installation_metrics`
- `refresh_content_type_cache`
- `refresh_dynamic_group_member_caches`

!!! note
    Commands listed here that are not covered in this document here are Django built-in commands.

`--no-clearsessions`  
Do not automatically clean out expired sessions.

`--no-collectstatic`  
Do not automatically collect static files into a single location.

`--no-invalidate-all`  
Do not automatically invalidate cache for entire application.

`--no-migrate`  
Do not automatically perform any database migrations.

`--no-remove-stale-contenttypes`  
Do not automatically remove stale content types.

`--no-trace-paths`  
Do not automatically generate missing cable paths.

`--no-refresh-content-type-cache`  
Do not automatically refresh the content type cache.

`--no-refresh-dynamic-group-member-caches`  
Do not automatically refresh the dynamic group member lists.

```no-highlight
nautobot-server post_upgrade
```

Example Output:

```no-highlight
Performing database migrations...
Operations to perform:

Invalidating cache...
```

### `refresh_dynamic_group_member_caches`

+++ 1.6.0

`nautobot-server refresh_dynamic_group_member_caches`

Refresh the cached members of all Dynamic Groups. This is useful to periodically update the cached list of members of a Dynamic Group without having to wait for caches to expire, which defaults to one hour.

### `refresh_content_type_caches`

+++ 1.6.0

`nautobot-server refresh_content_type_caches`

Refresh the cached ContentType object property available via `Model._content_type_cached`. If content types are added or removed, this command will update the cache to reflect the current state of the database, but should already be done through the `post_upgrade` command.

### `remove_stale_scheduled_jobs`

+++ 1.3.10

`nautobot-server remove_stale_scheduled_jobs [max-age of days]`

Delete non-recurring scheduled jobs that were scheduled to run more than `max-age` days ago.

### `renaturalize`

`nautobot-server renaturalize [app_label.ModelName [app_label.ModelName ...]]`

Recalculate natural ordering values for the specified models.

This defaults to recalculating natural ordering on all models which have one or more fields of type `NaturalOrderingField`:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server renaturalize
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
Renaturalizing 21 models.
dcim.ConsolePort.name (_name)... 196
dcim.ConsoleServerPort.name (_name)... 0
dcim.PowerPort.name (_name)... 392
dcim.PowerOutlet.name (_name)... 0
dcim.Interface.name (_name)... 7161
dcim.FrontPort.name (_name)... 0
dcim.RearPort.name (_name)... 0
dcim.DeviceBay.name (_name)... 0
dcim.InventoryItem.name (_name)... 1
dcim.Device.name (_name)... 208
dcim.ConsolePortTemplate.name (_name)... 2
dcim.ConsoleServerPortTemplate.name (_name)... 0
dcim.PowerPortTemplate.name (_name)... 4
dcim.PowerOutletTemplate.name (_name)... 0
dcim.InterfaceTemplate.name (_name)... 221
dcim.FrontPortTemplate.name (_name)... 0
dcim.RearPortTemplate.name (_name)... 0
dcim.DeviceBayTemplate.name (_name)... 0
dcim.Rack.name (_name)... 156
dcim.Site.name (_name)... 22
virtualization.VMInterface.name (_name)... 0
Done.
```

You may optionally specify or more specific models (each prefixed with its app_label) to renaturalize:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server renaturalize dcim.Device
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
Renaturalizing 1 models.
dcim.Device.name (_name)... 208
Done.
```

### `runjob`

`nautobot-server runjob [job]`

Run a job (script, report) to validate or update data in Nautobot.

`--commit`  
Commit changes to DB (defaults to dry-run if unset). `--username` is mandatory if using this argument.

`--username <username>`  
User account to impersonate as the requester of this job.

```no-highlight
nautobot-server runjob --commit --username someuser local/example/MyJobWithNoVars
```

Note that there is presently no option to provide input parameters (`data`) for jobs via the CLI.

Please see the [guide on Jobs](../additional-features/jobs.md) for more information on working with and running jobs.

### `send_installation_metrics`

+++ 1.6.0

`nautobot-server send_installation_metrics`

Send anonymized installation metrics to the Nautobot maintainers. This management command is called by [`post_upgrade`](#post_upgrade) and is not intended to be run manually.

If the [`INSTALLATION_METRICS_ENABLED`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#installation_metrics_enabled) setting is `True`, this command will send a list of all installed [plugins](../plugins/index.md) and their versions, as well as the currently installed Nautobot and Python versions, to the Nautobot maintainers. A randomized UUID will be generated and saved in the [`DEPLOYMENT_ID`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#deployment_id) setting to anonymously but uniquely identify this installation. The plugin names will be one-way hashed with SHA256 to further anonymize the data sent. This enables tracking the installation metrics of publicly released plugins without disclosing the names of any private plugins.

The following is an example of the data that is sent:

```py
{
    "deployment_id": "1de3dacf-f046-4a98-8d4a-17419080db79",
    "nautobot_version": "1.6.0b1",
    "python_version": "3.10.12",
    "installed_apps": {
        # "example_plugin" hashed by sha256
        "3ffee4622af3aad6f78257e3ae12da99ca21d71d099f67f4a2e19e464453bee7": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

### `start`

`nautobot-server start`

Directly invoke uWSGI to start a Nautobot server suitable for production use. This command behaves exactly as uWSGI does, but allows us to maintain a single entrypoint into the Nautobot application.

!!! note
    uWSGI offers an overwhelming amount of command-line arguments that could not possibly be covered here. Please see the [official uWSGI Options guide](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html) for more information.

```no-highlight
nautobot-server start --ini ./uwsgi.ini
```

Example output:

```no-highlight

```

Please see the guide on [Deploying Nautobot Services](../installation/services.md) for our recommended configuration for use with uWSGI.

### `startplugin`

`nautobot-server startplugin <name> [directory]`

Create a new plugin with `name`.

This command is similar to the django-admin [startapp](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#startapp) command, but with a default template directory (`--template`) of `nautobot/core/templates/plugin_template`. This command assists with creating a basic file structure for beginning development of a new Nautobot plugin.

Without passing in the destination directory, `nautobot-server startplugin` will use your current directory and the `name` argument provided to create a new directory. We recommend providing a directory so that the plugin can be installed or published easily. Here is an example:

```no-highlight
mkdir -p ~/myplugin/myplugin
nautobot-server startplugin myplugin ~/myplugin/myplugin
```

Additional options such as `--name` or `--extension` can be found in the Django [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#startapp).

### `trace_paths`

`nautobot-server trace_paths`

Generate any missing cable paths among all cable termination objects in Nautobot.

After upgrading the database or working with Cables, Circuits, or other related objects, there may be a need to rebuild cached cable paths.

`--force`  
Force recalculation of all existing cable paths.

`--no-input`  
Do not prompt user for any input/confirmation.

```no-highlight
nautobot-server trace_paths
```

Example output:

Found no missing console server port paths; skipping
Found no missing interface paths; skipping
Found no missing power feed paths; skipping
Found no missing power outlet paths; skipping

```

!!! note
    This command is safe to run at any time. If it does detect any changes, it will exit cleanly.
