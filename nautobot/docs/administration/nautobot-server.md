# The Nautobot Server Command

Nautobot includes a command-line (CLI) management utility called `nautobot-server`, that is used as a single entrypoint for common administrative tasks.

## Background

For those familiar with Django applications, this CLI utility works exactly as a project's `manage.py` script would, except that it comes bundled with the Nautobot code and therefore it gets automatically installed in the `bin` directory of your application environment.

!!! important
    Since Nautobot is a Django application, there are a number of built-in management commands that will not be covered in this document. Please see the [official Django documentation on management commands](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#available-commands) for more information.

!!! important
    Django does not recognize `nautobot-server`.  Anywhere `python manage.py` is mentioned, it is safe to replace with `nautobot-server`.

## Getting Help

To see all available management commands:

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server help
```

All management commands have a `-h/--help` flag to list all available arguments for that command, for example:

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server migrate --help
```

## Available Commands

### `celery`

`nautobot-server celery`

Celery command entrypoint which serves as a thin wrapper to the `celery` command that includes the Nautobot Celery application context. This allows us to execute Celery commands without having to worry about the chicken-and-egg problem with bootstrapping the Django settings.

Most commonly you will be using this command to start the Celery worker process:

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server celery worker --loglevel INFO --pidfile $(pwd)/nautobot-celery.pid -n worker1

celery@worker1 v5.1.1 (sun-harmonics)

[config]
.> app:         nautobot:0x10c357eb0
.> transport:   redis://localhost:6379/0
.> results:     redis://localhost:6379/0
.> concurrency: 8 (prefork)
.> task events: OFF (enable -E to monitor tasks in this worker)

[queues]
.> celery           exchange=celery(direct) key=celery


[tasks]
  . nautobot.extras.datasources.git.pull_git_repository_and_refresh_data
  . nautobot.extras.jobs.run_job
  . nautobot.extras.tasks.delete_custom_field_data
  . nautobot.extras.tasks.process_webhook
  . nautobot.extras.tasks.provision_field
  . nautobot.extras.tasks.update_custom_field_choice_data
  . nautobot.utilities.tasks.get_releases

[2021-07-01 21:32:40,680: INFO/MainProcess] Connected to redis://localhost:6379/0
[2021-07-01 21:32:40,690: INFO/MainProcess] mingle: searching for neighbors
[2021-07-01 21:32:41,713: INFO/MainProcess] mingle: all alone
[2021-07-01 21:32:41,730: INFO/MainProcess] celery@worker1 ready.
```

!!! note
    The internals of this command are built into Celery. Please see the [official Celery workers guide](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/workers.html) for more information.

### `collectstatic`

`nautobot-server collectstatic`

Collect static files into [`STATIC_ROOT`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#static_root).

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server collectstatic

965 static files copied to '/opt/nautobot/static'.
```

!!! note
    This is a built-in Django command. Please see the [official documentation on `collectstatic`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#collectstatic) for more information.

### `createsuperuser`

`nautobot-server createsuperuser`

Creates a superuser account that has all permissions.

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'jathan'): example
Email address: example@localhost
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.
```

!!! note
    This is a built-in Django command. Please see the [official documentation on `createsuperuser`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#createsuperuser) for more information.

### `dbshell`

`nautobot-server dbshell`

A shell for your database. This can be very useful in troubleshooting raw database issues.

!!! danger
    This is an advanced feature that gives you direct access to run raw SQL queries. Use this very cautiously as you can cause irreparable damage to your Nautobot installation.

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server dbshell
psql (12.6 (Ubuntu 12.6-0ubuntu0.20.04.1))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

nautobot=> \conninfo
You are connected to database "nautobot" as user "nautobot" on host "localhost" (address "::1") at port "5432".
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
nautobot=> \q
```

!!! note
    This is a built-in Django command. Please see the [official documentation on `dbshell`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#dbshell) for more information.

### `dumpdata`

+/- 1.3.0
    - `extras.job` should now be included in the dump (removed `--exclude extras.job` from the example usage)
    - `django_rq` should now be excluded from the dump (added `--exclude django_rq` to the example usage)

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server dumpdata \
  --natural-foreign \
  --natural-primary \
  --exclude contenttypes \
  --exclude auth.permission \
  --exclude django_rq \
  --format json \
  --indent 2 \
  --traceback  > nautobot_dump.json
```

Use this command to generate a JSON dump of the database contents.

One example of using this command would be to [`export data from PostgreSQL`](../installation/migrating-from-postgresql.md#export-data-from-postgresql).

### `fix_custom_fields`

`nautobot-server fix_custom_fields`

Adds/Removes any custom fields which should or should not exist on an object.  This command should not be run unless a custom fields jobs has failed:

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server fix_custom_fields
Processing ContentType dcim | device
Processing ContentType dcim | site
Processing ContentType dcim | rack
Processing ContentType dcim | cable
Processing ContentType dcim | power feed
Processing ContentType circuits | circuit
Processing ContentType ipam | prefix
... (truncated for brevity of documentation) ...
```

### `generate_secret_key`

`nautobot-server generate_secret_key`

Generates a new [`SECRET_KEY`](../configuration/required-settings.md#secret_key) that can be used in your `nautobot_config.py`:

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server generate_secret_key
e!j=vrlhz-!wl8p_3+q5s5cph29nzj$xm81eap-!&n!_9^du09
```

### `health_check`

`nautobot-server health_check`

Run health checks and exit 0 if everything went well.

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server health_check
DatabaseBackend          ... working
DefaultFileStorageHealthCheck ... working
RedisBackend             ... working
```

Please see the [healthcheck documentation](../additional-features/healthcheck.md) for more information.

### `init`

`nautobot-server init [config_path]`

Generates a new configuration with all of the default settings provided for you, and will also generate a unique[`SECRET_KEY`](../configuration/required-settings.md#secret_key).

By default the file will be created at `$HOME/.nautobot/nautobot_config.py`:

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server init
Configuration file created at '/home/example/.nautobot/nautobot_config.py
```

For more information on configuring Nautobot for the first time or on more advanced configuration patterns, please see the guide on [Nautobot Configuration](../configuration/index.md).

### `invalidate`

`nautobot-server invalidate`

Invalidates cache for entire app, model or particular instance. Most commonly you will see us recommend clearing the entire cache using `invalidate all`:

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server invalidate all
```

There are a number of other options not covered here.

!!! note
    This is a built-in management command provided by the [Cacheops plugin](https://github.com/Suor/django-cacheops) Nautobot for caching. Please see the official [Cacheops documentation on `invalidate`](https://github.com/Suor/django-cacheops#invalidation) for more information.

### `loaddata`

`nautobot-server loaddata --traceback nautobot_dump.json`

To import the data that was exported with `nautobot-server dumpdata ...` see the following documentation:

- [`Remove the auto-populated Status records from the database`](../installation/migrating-from-postgresql.md#remove-the-auto-populated-status-records-from-the-mysql-database)
- [`Import the database dump`](../installation/migrating-from-postgresql.md#import-the-database-dump-into-mysql)

### `migrate`

`nautobot-server migrate [app_label] [migration_name]`

Initialize a new database or run any pending database migrations to an existing database.

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server migrate
Wrapping model clean methods for custom validators failed because the ContentType table was not available or populated. This is normal during the execution of the migration command for the first time.
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, circuits, contenttypes, dcim, extras, ipam, sessions, taggit, tenancy, users, virtualization
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
... (truncated for brevity of documentation) ...
```

!!! note
    This is a built-in Django command. Please see the [official documentation on `migrate`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#migrate) for more information.

### `nbshell`

`nautobot-server nbshell`

An interactive Python shell with all of the database models and various other utilities already imported for you. This is immensely useful for direct access to manipulating database objects.

!!! danger
    This is an advanced feature that gives you direct access to the Django database models. Use this very cautiously as you can cause irreparable damage to your Nautobot installation.

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server nbshell
### Nautobot interactive shell (localhost)
### Python 3.8.7 | Django 3.1.7 | Nautobot 1.0.0
### lsmodels() will show available models. Use help(<model>) for more info.
>>>
```

Please see the dedicated guide on the [Nautobot Shell](nautobot-shell.md) for more information.

### `post_upgrade`

`nautobot-server post_upgrade`

Performs common server post-upgrade operations using a single entrypoint.

This will run the following management commands with default settings, in order:

- `migrate`
- `trace_paths`
- `collectstatic`
- `remove_stale_contenttypes`
- `clearsessions`
- `invalidate all`

### `renaturalize`

`nautobot-server renaturalize [app_label.ModelName [app_label.ModelName ...]]`

Recalculate natural ordering values for the specified models.

This defaults to recalculating natural ordering on all models which have one or more fields of type `NaturalOrderingField`:

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server renaturalize
Renaturalizing 21 models.
dcim.ConsolePort.name (_name)... 196

```

You may optionally specify or more specific models (each prefixed with its app_label) to renaturalize:

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server renaturalize dcim.Device
Renaturalizing 1 models.
dcim.Device.name (_name)... 208

```

### `runjob`

`nautobot-server runjob [job]`

`--commit`  
Commit changes to DB (defaults to dry-run if unset). `--username` is mandatory if using this argument.

`--username <username>`  
User account to impersonate as the requester of this job.

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server runjob --commit --username someuser local/example/MyJobWithNoVars
```

Note that there is presently no option to provide input parameters (`data`) for jobs via the CLI.

Please see the [guide on Jobs](../additional-features/jobs.md) for more information on working with and running jobs.

### `start`

`nautobot-server start`

Directly invoke uWSGI to start a Nautobot server suitable for production use. This command behaves exactly as uWSGI does, but allows us to maintain a single entrypoint into the Nautobot application.

!!! note
    uWSGI offers an overwhelming amount of command-line arguments that could not possibly be covered here. Please see the [official uWSGI Options guide](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html) for more information.

```no-highlight

### `startplugin`

`nautobot-server startplugin <name> [directory]`

Create a new plugin with `name`.

This command is similar to the django-admin [startapp](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#startapp) command, but with a default template directory (`--template`) of `nautobot/core/templates/plugin_template`. This command assists with creating a basic file structure for beginning development of a new Nautobot plugin.

Without passing in the destination directory, `nautobot-server startplugin` will use your current directory and the `name` argument provided to create a new directory. We recommend providing a  directory so that the plugin can be installed or published easily. Here is an example:

```no-highlight
$ mkdir -p ~/myplugin/myplugin
$ nautobot-server startplugin myplugin ~/myplugin/myplugin
```

Additional options such as `--name` or `--extension` can be found in the Django [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#startapp).

### `trace_paths`

`nautobot-server trace_paths`

Generate any missing cable paths among all cable termination objects in Nautobot.

After upgrading the database or working with Cables, Circuits, or other related objects, there may be a need to rebuild cached cable paths.

`--force`  
Force recalculation of all existing cable paths.

`--no-input`  
Do not prompt user for any input/confirmation.

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server trace_paths
Found no missing circuit termination paths; skipping
Found no missing console port paths; skipping
Found no missing console server port paths; skipping
Found no missing interface paths; skipping
Found no missing power feed paths; skipping
Found no missing power outlet paths; skipping
Found no missing power port paths; skipping
Finished.
```

!!! note
    This command is safe to run at any time. If it does detect any changes, it will exit cleanly.

### `webhook_receiver`

`nautobot-server webhook_receiver`

Start a simple listener to display received HTTP requests.

`--port PORT`  
Optional port number (default: `9000`)

`--no-headers`  
Hide HTTP request headers.

```no-highlight
$ nautobot-server webhook_receiver --port 9001 --no-headers
Listening on port http://localhost:9000. Stop with CONTROL-C.
```

Please see the guide on [Troubleshooting Webhooks](../models/extras/webhook.md#troubleshooting) for more information.
