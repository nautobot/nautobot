# App Development

This documentation covers the development of custom Apps for Nautobot. Nautobot apps are essentially self-contained [Django applications](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/applications/) which integrate with Nautobot to provide custom functionality. Since the development of Django applications is already very well-documented, this will only be covering the aspects that are specific to Nautobot.

Apps can [do a lot of different things](./index.md#capabilities), all of which will be covered in detail in this document.
Keep in mind that each piece of functionality is entirely optional. For example, if your app merely adds a piece of middleware or an API endpoint for existing data, there's no need to define any new models.

+/- 1.5.2
    The `nautobot.apps` namespace was added in Nautobot 1.5.2. If developing apps to be backwards-compatible with older versions of Nautobot, please refer to the app developer documentation of your required Nautobot version.

!!! tip
    The app detail view (`/apps/installed-apps/<app_name>/`, accessible via **Apps -> Installed Apps** in the navigation menu, then selecting a specific app) provides in-depth information about which features any installed app is implementing or making use of.

## Installing and Using Apps

Nautobot Apps are packaged [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/) apps that can be installed alongside Nautobot to provide custom functionality not present in the core application. Apps can introduce their own models and views, but cannot interfere with existing components. A Nautobot user may opt to install Apps provided by the community or build his or her own.

## Capabilities

The Nautobot App architecture allows for Apps to do any or all of the following:

### Extend the existing Nautobot UI

* **Add navigation menu items.** An App can extend the navigation menus with new links and buttons or even entirely new menus.
* **Add home page content.** An App can add custom items or custom panels to the Nautobot home page.
* **Add content to existing model detail views.** An App can inject custom HTML content within the view of a core Nautobot model. This content can appear in the left column, right column, or full width of the page, and can also include custom buttons at the top of the page.

+++ 1.2.0
    * **Add a banner.** An App can add a custom banner to the top of any appropriate views.

+++ 1.4.0
    * **Add extra tabs to existing model detail views.** An App can inject additional tabs which will appear at the end of the object detail tabs list.

### Extend and customize existing Nautobot functionality

* **Add custom validation logic to existing data models.** An App can provide additional logic to customize the rules for validating created/updated data records.
* **Provide Jobs.** An App can serve as a convenient way to package and install [Jobs](../../user-guide/platform-functionality/jobs/index.md).
* **Add additional Git data types.** An App can add support for processing additional types of data stored in a [Git repository](../../user-guide/platform-functionality/gitrepository.md).

+++ 1.1.0
    * **Register additional Jinja2 filters.** An App can define custom Jinja2 filters to be used in computed fields, webhooks, custom links, and export templates.

+++ 1.2.0
    * **Populate extensibility features in the database.** An App can add content to the Nautobot database when installed, such as automatically creating new custom fields, relationships, and so forth.

    * **Add additional secrets providers.** An App can add support for retrieving [Secret](../../user-guide/platform-functionality/secret.md) values from additional sources or external systems.

+++ 1.4.0
    * **Override already-defined views.** An App can define a view which can be set to override a view from the core set of views or another App's view.

### Add entirely new features

* **Add new data models.** An App can introduce one or more models to hold data. (A model is essentially a table in the SQL database.) These models can be integrated with core implementations of GraphQL, webhooks, logging, custom relationships, custom fields, and tags.
* **Add new URLs and views.** An App can register URLs under the `/plugins/` root path to provide browseable views (pages) for users.
* **Add new REST API endpoints.** An App can register URLs under the `/api/plugins/` root path to provide new REST API views.
* **Add custom middleware.** An App can provide and register custom Django middleware.

+++ 2.0.0
    * **Register data models for the global search.** An App's data models can easily be included in the top-level "global" search.

### Declare dependencies and requirements

* **Declare configuration parameters.** An App can define required, optional, and default configuration parameters within its unique namespace. App configuration parameters are configurable under [`PLUGINS_CONFIG`](../../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#plugins_config) in `nautobot_config.py`.
* **Limit installation by Nautobot version.** An App can specify a minimum and/or maximum Nautobot version with which it is compatible.
* **Add additional Django dependencies.** An App can define additional Django application dependencies to require when the App is enabled.

## Limitations

Either by policy or by technical limitation, the interaction of Apps with Nautobot core is restricted in certain ways. An App may not:

* **Modify core models.** Apps may not alter, remove, or override core Nautobot models in any way. This rule is in place to ensure the integrity of the core data model.
* **Register URLs outside the `/plugins` root.** All App URLs are restricted to this path to prevent path collisions with core or other Apps.
* **Override core templates.** Apps can inject additional content where supported, but may not manipulate or remove core content.
* **Modify core settings.** A configuration registry is provided for Apps, however they cannot alter or delete the core configuration.
* **Disable core components.** Apps are not permitted to disable or hide core Nautobot components.
