# Migrating UI v2.x to v3.0

Nautobot v3.0 introduces many modernizations and improvements to building user interfaces. Although we did our best to make the migration as smooth as possible for app developers, we were not able to avoid some of the **breaking changes**. Below is a list of guides explaining how to upgrade respective UI parts.

Overall, there are three pillars of v3.0 UI:

1. [Introduction of UI component framework.](../ui-component-framework/index.md)
2. [Bootstrap v3.4.1 to v5.x upgrade.](./upgrading-from-bootstrap-v3-to-v5.md)
3. [New Nautobot custom UI APIs.](./new-nautobot-custom-ui-apis.md)

Remember to follow our [UI Best Practices](../../../core/ui-best-practices.md).
