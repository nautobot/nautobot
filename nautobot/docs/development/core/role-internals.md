# Role Internals

!!! warning
    The section below is largely intended for developers who may need to create
    data models of their own that implement a `role` field. Proceed at your
    own risk!

Any model that is intended to have a `role` field must use a `nautobot.extras.models.roles.RoleField` field for its foreign-key to the Role model. This field type will automatically assign a `related_name` for the reverse relationship back to the inheriting model's verbose plural name (e.g. `devices`).

## `RoleField` model field

The `RoleField` field type is a subclass of `django.db.models.ForeignKey`.

This model field also emits its own form field to eliminate the requirement for a form field to be explicitly added to model forms.

## `RoleFilter` filter field

Any filter that is intended to have a `role` field must inherit from `nautobot.extras.filters.RoleModelFilterSetMixin`. This will add a `nautobot.extras.filters.RoleFilter` to the filter, which allows filtering by the `name` or `id` of the role.

## Form fields

Any filter form that is intended to have a `role` field must inherit from `nautobot.extras.forms.RoleModelFilterFormMixin`. This mixin adds a non-required, multiple-choice `role` filter field to the filter form.

Any bulk edit form that is intended to have a `role` field must inherit from `nautobot.extras.forms.RoleModelBulkEditFormMixin`. This mixin adds a non-required `role` field to the form, and constrains the eligible role choices to the object type being edited.

## Table field

If you wish for a table to include a `role` column, your table must inherit from `nautobot.extras.tables.RoleTableMixin`. This includes a `ColorColumn` with the header `role` on the table.
