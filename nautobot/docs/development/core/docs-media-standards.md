# Media Standards

There are three primary types of media used in our documentation:

- **Screenshots**: Visual representations of the user interface.
- **Instructional Images**: Targeted visuals that illustrate specific steps or workflows.
- **Diagrams**: Visualizations (such as ERD or UML diagrams) that explain engineering concepts or system architecture.

All media files should be stored in a folder named `media` or its subfolders within the documentation directory.

## Screenshot Standards

Screenshots are essential for demonstrating product functionality. Follow these standards to ensure clarity and consistency:

- Use Chrome's ["Capture a full-page screenshot"](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/devtools-tips-33) for all screenshots.
- Standardize screenshot widths:
    - **1920 px** – Full Screen or List View
    - **1024 px** – Center Panel (e.g., Edit or Job Form)
    - **760 px** – Side Panels (Right or Left)
    - **360 px** – Navbar
- For consistent screenshots, create a [custom device](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode#custom) in Chrome with:
    - Width: **1280 px**
    - Height: **960 px**
    - Device Pixel Ratio: **1.5**
    - User Agent: **Desktop**
- Adjust height as needed to capture relevant content; avoid unnecessary context.
- Always use Chrome's "Capture Screenshot" tool (not "Capture full size screenshot").
    - For specific widths, crop using an image editor (e.g., Preview on macOS or Paint.NET on Windows).
    - Keep partial screenshots clean—avoid cutting off sections awkwardly.
- Save screenshots in **PNG** format.
- Use realistic data in screenshots; avoid placeholder text like "foobar" or records generated by the `generate_test_data` factories.
- Capture both light and dark modes, and include the source URL as a comment. Example:

    ```markdown
    ![Filter Button](../../feature-guides/images/saved-views/filter-button_light.png#only-light){ .on-glb }
    ![Filter Button](../../feature-guides/images/saved-views/filter-button_dark.png#only-dark){ .on-glb }
    [//]: # "`https://next.demo.nautobot.com/dcim/locations/`"
    ```

- To highlight specific areas in a screenshot, use a red line with a thickness of 3 pixels.
- After adding or modifying any screenshots, run `poetry run invoke compress-images --fix --path ...` to automatically optimize the images in the given directory for file size.

## Instructions Standards

Generally, instructional images are created by Network to Code due to their complexity. As a result, the standards and guidelines for producing these images are maintained internally.

## Diagram Standards

While we have not converged an single style, our standards for diagrams include:

- Use [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) style for ERD or UML diagrams directly in markdown.
- For other diagrams, maintain a single Draw.io file named `nautobot-diagrams.drawio`.
    - The first tab should map diagram topics to their corresponding files or documentation sections.
    - Each subsequent tab should focus on a specific diagram or topic.
    - Save the Draw.io file in XML format (not base64 or binary) so it can be tracked easier via version control in GitHub.
