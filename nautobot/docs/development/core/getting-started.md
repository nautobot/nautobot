# Getting Started

## Git Branches

The Nautobot project follows a branching model based on [Git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). As such, there are three persistent git branches:

* `main` - Serves as a snapshot of the current stable release
* `develop` - All bug fixes and minor feature development on the upcoming stable release occurs here
* `next` - All major new feature development for the next feature release occurs here.

You will always base pull requests off of either the `develop` branch, for fixes and minor features, or `next`, if you're working on a feature targeted for a later release. **Never** target fix or feature pull requests into the `main` branch, which receives merges only from the `develop` branch and only for new stable releases of Nautobot.

## Forking the Repo

When developing Nautobot, you'll be working on your own fork, so your first step will be to [fork the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/fork). You will then clone your GitHub fork locally for development.

!!! note
    It is highly recommended that you use SSH with GitHub. If you haven't already, make sure that you [setup Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) and [add an SSH key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) before proceeding.

In this guide, SSH will be used to interact with Git.

```no-highlight
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/nautobot.git
```

Example output:

```no-highlight

### About Remote Repos

Git refers to remote repositories as *remotes*. When you make your initial clone of your fork, Git defaults to naming this remote `origin`. Throughout this documentation, the following remote names will be used:

* `origin` - The default remote name used to refer to *your fork of Nautobot*
* `upstream` - The main remote used to refer to the *official Nautobot repository*

### Setting up your Remotes

Remote repos are managed using the `git remote` command.

Upon cloning Nautobot for the first time, you will have only a single remote:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->

```no-highlight
git remote -v
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
origin	git@github.com:yourusername/nautobot.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:yourusername/nautobot.git (push)
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD010 -->

Add the official Nautobot repo as a the `upstream` remote:

```no-highlight
git remote add upstream git@github.com:nautobot/nautobot.git
```

View your remotes again to confirm you've got both `origin` pointing to your fork and `upstream` pointing to the official repo:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->

```no-highlight
git remote -v
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
origin	git@github.com:yourusername/nautobot.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:yourusername/nautobot.git (push)
upstream	git@github.com:nautobot/nautobot.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:nautobot/nautobot.git (push)
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD010 -->

You're now ready to proceed to the next steps.

!!! hint
    You will always **push** changes to `origin` (your fork) and **pull** changes from `upstream` (official repo).

### Creating a Branch

Before you make any changes, always create a new branch. Again, for bug fixes and minor features, you'll want to create your branches from the `develop` branch, while for major new features, you'll branch from `next` instead.

Before you ever create a new branch, always checkout the appropriate branch and make sure you you've got the latest changes from `upstream`:

```no-highlight
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
```

!!! warning
    If you do not do this, you run the risk of having merge conflicts in your branch, and that's never fun to deal with. Trust us on this one.

Now that you've got the latest upstream changes, create your branch. Whether you're creating a branch off a fork or working against the Nautobot origin repo, you should follow this convention for naming your branch: `u/yourusername-0000-branch-summary`, where `0000` is the related GitHub issue number and `yourusername` is your GitHub username. For example:

```no-highlight
git checkout -b u/yourusername-1234-next-amazing-feature
```

If you do not have a relevant GitHub issue, please consider opening one to document the context behind your changes.

#### Prototypes

Sometimes code is written as a proof of concept or early implementation candidate but is not quite ready to be merged, or may be picked up by another author sometime in the future. In that case, the convention is to use the `prototype/` prefix to the branch name and not requiring the original authors username. In that scenario, using the example above, you would instead:

```no-highlight
git checkout -b prototype/1234-next-amazing-feature
```

## Enabling Pre-Commit Hooks

Nautobot ships with a [Git pre-commit hook](https://githooks.com/) script that automatically checks for style compliance and missing database migrations prior to committing changes. This helps avoid erroneous commits that result in CI test failures.

!!! note
    This pre-commit hook currently only supports the Python Virtual Environment Workflow.

You are encouraged to enable it by creating a link to `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`:

```no-highlight
cd .git/hooks/
ln -s ../../scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit
```

## Setting up your Development Environment

Getting started with Nautobot development is pretty straightforward, and should feel very familiar to anyone with Django development experience. We can recommend either a [Docker Compose workflow](#docker-compose-workflow) (if you don't want to install dependencies such as PostgreSQL and Redis directly onto your system) or a [Python virtual environment workflow](#python-virtual-environment-workflow).

### Windows Development

The Docker Compose development workflow on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has been tested successfully with [Docker Desktop using the WSL2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) and the Ubuntu 20.04 WSL2 distribution. The Poetry workflow has also been tested successfully on the Ubuntu 20.04 WSL2 distribution.

To install WSL2 and Ubuntu follow the instructions from the [WSL installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or if running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher you can open an administrator Powershell terminal and enter the following command:

```ps1
wsl --install
```

This will install the WSL2 Ubuntu distribution. Reboot if prompted. After the image installs successfully you may install Docker Desktop with the WSL2 backend.

### Docker Compose Workflow

This workflow uses [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and assumes that you have them installed.

For the Docker Compose workflow, Nautobot uses [Invoke](http://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/latest/index.html) as a replacement for Make. Invoke was chosen because it is less arcane than make. Instead of a `Makefile`, Invoke reads the `tasks.py` in the project root.

!!! note
    Although the Docker Compose workflow uses containers, it is important to note that the containers are running the local repository code on your machine. Changes you make to your local code will be picked up and executed by the containers.

#### Install Invoke

Because it is used to execute all common Docker workflow tasks, Invoke must be installed for your user environment. On most systems, if you're installing without root/superuser permissions, the default will install into your local user environment.

```no-highlight
pip3 install invoke
```

If you run into issues, you may also deliberately tell `pip3` to install into your user environment by adding the `--user` flag:

```no-highlight
pip3 install --user invoke
```

Please see the [official documentation on Pip user installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs) for more information.

#### List Invoke Tasks

Now that you have an `invoke` command, list the tasks defined in `tasks.py`:

```no-highlight
invoke --list
```

Example output:

```no-highlight

```

#### Using Docker with Invoke

A development environment can be easily started up from the root of the project using the following commands:

* `invoke build` - Builds Nautobot docker images
* `invoke migrate` - Performs database migration operation in Django
* `invoke createsuperuser` - Creates a superuser account for the Nautobot application
* `invoke debug` - Starts Docker containers for Nautobot, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, and Celery Beat in debug mode and attaches their output to the terminal in the foreground. You may enter Control-C to stop the containers

Additional useful commands for the development environment:

* `invoke start [-s servicename]` - Starts Docker containers for Nautobot, PostgreSQL, Redis, NGINX, Node.js, Celery, and Celery Beat (or a specific container/service, such as `invoke start -s redis`) to run in the background with debug disabled
* `invoke cli [-s servicename]` - Launch a `bash` shell inside the specified service container (if none is specified, defaults to the Nautobot container)
* `invoke stop [-s servicename]` - Stops all containers (or a specific container/service) created by `invoke start`

!!! note
    The `mkdocs` and `storybook` containers (see later) are not started automatically by `invoke start` or `invoke debug`. If desired, these may be started manually with `invoke start -s mkdocs` or `invoke start -s storybook` as appropriate.

!!! tip
    The Nautobot server uses a Django webservice and worker uses watchdog to provide automatic reload of your web and worker servers in **most** cases when using `invoke start` or `invoke debug`.

!!! tip
    To learn about advanced use cases within the Docker Compose workflow, see the [Docker Compose Advanced Use Cases](docker-compose-advanced-use-cases.md) page.

Proceed to the [Working in your Development Environment](#working-in-your-development-environment) section

### Python Virtual Environment Workflow

This workflow uses Python and Poetry to work with your development environment locally. It requires that you install the required system dependencies on your system yourself.

There are a few things you'll need:

* A Linux system or environment
* A MySQL or PostgreSQL server, which can be installed locally [per the documentation](../../user-guide/administration/installation/index.md#installing-nautobot-dependencies)
* A Redis server, which can also be [installed locally](../../user-guide/administration/installation/index.md#installing-nautobot-dependencies)
* A supported version of Python
* A recent version of [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

#### Install Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update/remove) them for you. It will also manage virtual environments automatically, and allow for publishing packages to the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org).

You may install Poetry in your user environment by running:

```no-highlight
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

+/- 1.5.6
    Poetry 1.3+ is required to be able to install packages against the latest lockfile.

!!! danger
    Always utilize this documented method to install Poetry for use when developing Nautobot.

    Never use `pip` to install Poetry into your Nautobot virtual environment, as it will result in dependency version conflicts that will very likely break Nautobot. Poetry is used as a package manager for Python packages, so you should not install it into the Nautobot environment, because it relies upon a number of the same dependencies as Nautobot, but with conflicting versions.

    While there are certain cases where running `pip install poetry` is valid, such as in Nautobot's automated release deployments where Nautobot is not actually installed, installing Poetry into Nautobot's runtime development environment is not one of them!

For detailed installation instructions, please see the [official Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

#### Install Hadolint

[Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) is a tool used to validate and lint Dockerfiles to ensure we are following best practices. On macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) you can install Hadolint by running:

```no-highlight
brew install hadolint
```

#### Install markdownlint-cli

[markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) is a tool used to validate and lint Markdown files, such as Nautobot's documentation, to ensure that they are correctly constructed. On macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) you can install markdownlint-cli by running:

```no-highlight
brew install markdownlint-cli
```

#### Install Node.JS and npm

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the tool used to install and compile the Nautobot front-end UI. On macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) you can install npm by running:

```no-highlight
brew install node@18
```

You should then move to the `nautobot/ui/` subdirectory and run `npm ci` to install all of the JS dependencies for local development of the Nautobot UI:

```no-highlight
npm ci
```

Be sure to switch back to the base directory of the repository after you do this.

#### Creating a Python Virtual Environment

A Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) (or *virtualenv*) is like a container for a set of Python packages. A virtualenv allow you to build environments suited to specific projects without interfering with system packages or other projects. When installed per the documentation, Nautobot uses a virtual environment in production.

For Nautobot development, we have selected Poetry, which will transparently create a virtualenv for you, automatically install all dependencies required for Nautobot to operate, and will also install the `nautobot-server` CLI command that you will utilize to interact with Nautobot from here on out.

Bootstrap your virtual environment using `poetry install`:

```no-highlight
poetry install
```

!!! hint
    If you are doing development or testing using MySQL, you may quickly install the `mysqlclient` library along with Nautobot by running `poetry install --extras mysql`.

This will create automatically create a virtualenv in your home directory, which houses a virtual copy of the Python executable and its related libraries and tooling. When running Nautobot for development, it will be run using the Python binary at found within the virtualenv.

Once created, you may activate the virtual environment using `poetry shell`:

```no-highlight
poetry shell
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
Spawning shell within /home/example/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/nautobot-Ams_xyDt-py3.8

. /home/example/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/nautobot-Ams_xyDt-py3.8/bin/activate
(nautobot-Ams_xyDt-py3.8) $
```

Notice that the console prompt changes to indicate the active environment. This updates the necessary system environment variables to ensure that any Python scripts are run within the virtual environment.

Observe also that the `python` interpreter is bound within the virtualenv:

```no-highlight
which python
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
(nautobot-Ams_xyDt-py3.8) $ /home/example/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/nautobot-Ams_xyDt-py3.8/bin/python
```

To exit the virtual shell, use `exit`:

```no-highlight
exit
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
$
```

#### Working with Poetry

Poetry automatically installs your dependencies. However, if you need to install any additional dependencies this can be done with `pip`. For example, if you really like using `ipython` for development:

```no-highlight
pip3 install ipython
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
Collecting ipython
  Using cached ipython-7.20.0-py3-none-any.whl (784 kB)
  ...
```

* Install verify that you have the proper dependencies installed and are in the virtual environment via Poetry. This also ensures that you have the proper mkdocs themes installed.

```bash
poetry shell
poetry install
```

It may not always be convenient to enter into the virtual shell just to run programs. You may also execute a given command ad hoc within the project's virtual shell by using `poetry run`:

```no-highlight
poetry run mkdocs serve
```

Check out the [Poetry usage guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) for more tips.

#### Configuring Nautobot

!!! note
    Unless otherwise noted, all following commands should be executed inside the virtualenv.

!!! hint
    Use `poetry shell` to enter the virtualenv.

Nautobot's configuration file is `nautobot_config.py`.

##### Initializing a Config

You may also initialize a new configuration using `nautobot-server init`:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server init
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
Nautobot would like to send anonymized installation metrics to the project's maintainers.
These metrics include the installed Nautobot version, the Python version in use, an anonymous "deployment ID", and a list of one-way-hashed names of enabled Nautobot Apps and their versions.
Allow Nautobot to send these metrics? [y/n]: n
Installation metrics will not be sent by default.
Configuration file created at /home/example/.nautobot/nautobot_config.py
```

You may also specify alternate file locations. Please refer to [Configuring Nautobot](../../user-guide/administration/configuration/index.md) for how to do that.

##### Using the Development Config

A `nautobot_config.py` suitable for development purposes can be found at `development/nautobot_config.py`. You may customize the values there or utilize environment variables to override the default values.

If you want to use this file, initialize a config first, then copy this file to the default location Nautobot expects to find its config:

```no-highlight
cp development/nautobot_config.py ~/.nautobot/nautobot_config.py
```

##### Required Settings

A newly created configuration includes sane defaults. If you need to customize them, edit your `nautobot_config.py` and update the following settings as required:

* [`ALLOWED_HOSTS`](../../user-guide/administration/configuration/required-settings.md#allowed_hosts): This can be set to `["*"]` for development purposes and must be set if `DEBUG=False`
* [`DATABASES`](../../user-guide/administration/configuration/required-settings.md#databases): Database connection parameters, if different from the defaults
* **Redis settings**: Redis configuration requires multiple settings. The defaults should be fine for development.
* [`DEBUG`](../../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#debug): Set to `True` to enable verbose exception logging and, if installed, the [Django debug toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [`EXTRA_INSTALLED_APPS`](../../user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings.md#extra-applications): Optionally provide a list of extra Django apps/plugins you may desire to use for development

## Working in your Development Environment

Below are common commands for working your development environment.

### Creating a Superuser

You'll need to create a administrative superuser account to be able to log into the Nautobot Web UI for the first time. Specifying an email address for the user is not required, but be sure to use a very strong password.

| Docker Compose Workflow  | Virtual Environment Workflow      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `invoke createsuperuser` | `nautobot-server createsuperuser` |

### Starting the Development Server

Django provides a lightweight HTTP/WSGI server for development use. The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request, as needed. You don’t need to restart the server for code changes to take effect. However, some actions like adding files don’t trigger a restart, so you’ll have to restart the server in these cases.

!!! danger
    **DO NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING.** The development server and watchdog is for development and testing purposes only. It is neither performant nor secure enough for production use.

You can start the Nautobot development server with the `invoke start` command (if using Docker), or the `nautobot-server runserver` management command:

| Docker Compose Workflow | Virtual Environment Workflow |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `invoke start`          | `nautobot-server runserver`  |

For example:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server runserver
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
November 18, 2020 - 15:52:31
Django version 3.1, using settings 'nautobot.core.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

!!! warning
    Do not use `poetry run nautobot-server runserver` as it will crash unless you also pass the `--noreload` flag, which somewhat defeats the purpose of using the development server. It is recommended to use `nautobot-server runserver` from within an active virtualenv (e.g. `poetry shell`). This is a [known issue with Django and Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2435).

Please see the [official Django documentation on `runserver`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#runserver) for more information.

!!! note
    When first started in Docker Compose, the Nautobot development server container will automatically install dependencies for building the React UI for Nautobot, then build this UI. This may take several minutes before the server becomes ready to accept web connections.

You can connect to the development server at `localhost:8080`, but normally you'll want to connect to the Node.js server instead (see below).

### Starting the Node.js Server

In development, you should run a Node.js server instance as well. This will handle automatically rebuilding the UI when you make changes in the `nautobot/ui` directory.

| Docker Compose Workflow | Virtual Environment Workflow    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `invoke start`          | `cd nautobot/ui; npm run start` |

!!! note
    In the Docker Compose workflow, the Node.js server will delay starting until the Nautobot development server has finished the initial UI build, which may take several minutes. This is normal.

You can connect to the Node.js server at `localhost:3000`.

### Starting the Storybook Server

When working on the UI, you may find it useful to run a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) instance that provides interactive documentation of the `nautobot-ui` library used by Nautobot's user interface.

| Docker Compose Workflow     | Virtual Environment Workflow    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `invoke start -s storybook` | `TODO`                          |

!!! note
    This container is not started by default when using `invoke start`. You must individually start it using `invoke start -s storybook`.

You can connect to Storybook at `localhost:6006`.

### Starting the Worker Server

In order to run Nautobot Jobs or anything that requires a worker you must start a Celery worker.

The worker is started in Docker Workflow with [watchdog](https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/) and can be setup to be started with watchdog in the Virtual Environment Workflow. Watchdog provides a similar experience to the Django lightweight HTTP/WSGI for restarting your application automatically. Watchdog can watch for changes on your filesystem, this is helpful when adjusting existing Python files to not have to restart the celery worker when testing jobs.

| Docker Compose Workflow | Virtual Environment Workflow    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `invoke start`          | `nautobot-server celery worker` |

!!! tip
    You can leverage watchdog for your celery worker as described above, with the following watchmedo command in your development environment `watchmedo auto-restart --directory './' --pattern '*.py' --recursive -- nautobot-server celery worker -l INFO --events`.

### Starting the Interactive Shell

Nautobot provides an [interactive Python shell](../../user-guide/administration/tools/nautobot-shell.md) that sets up the server environment and gives you direct access to the database models for debugging. Nautobot extends this slightly to automatically import models and other utilities.

Run the Nautobot interactive shell with `invoke nbshell` (Docker) or the `nautobot-server nbshell` management command:

| Docker Compose Workflow | Virtual Environment Workflow |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `invoke nbshell`        | `nautobot-server nbshell`    |

For example:

```bash
nautobot-server nbshell
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
# Shell Plus Model Imports
...
# Shell Plus Django Imports

# Django version 3.2.16
# Nautobot version 2.0.0a0
# Example Nautobot App version 1.0.0

```

### Post-upgrade Operations

There will be times where you're working with the bleeding edge of Nautobot from the `develop` branch or feature branches and will need to pull in database changes or run server operations.

Get into the habit of running `nautobot-server post_upgrade` (or `invoke post-upgrade` when using Docker) after you pull in a major set of changes from Nautobot, which performs a handful of common operations (such as `migrate`) from a single command:

Please see the [documentation on the `nautobot-server post_upgrade` command](../../user-guide/administration/tools/nautobot-server.md#post_upgrade) for more information.

### Reinstalling Nautobot

!!! note
    This mostly applies to working with Nautobot in a virtualenv, since Docker containers are typically rebuilt when the code changes.

Sometimes when files are renamed, moved, or deleted and you've been working in the same environment for a while, you can encounter weird behavior. If this happens, don't panic and nuke your environment.

First, use `pip3` to explicitly uninstall the Nautobot package from the environment:

```no-highlight
pip3 uninstall -y nautobot
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
Found existing installation: nautobot 1.0.0b2
Uninstalling nautobot-1.0.0b2:
  Successfully uninstalled nautobot-1.0.0b2
```

Then try to just have Poetry do the right thing by telling it to install again:

```no-highlight
poetry install
```

Example output:

```no-highlight
Installing dependencies from lock file

No dependencies to install or update

Installing the current project: nautobot (1.0.0-beta.2)
```

### Running Tests

Throughout the course of development, it's a good idea to occasionally run Nautobot's test suite to catch any potential errors. Tests come in two primary flavors: Unit tests and integration tests.

For information about **writing** tests, refer to the [testing documentation](testing.md).

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests are automated tests written and run to ensure that a section of the Nautobot application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended and expected. Most commonly as a developer of or contributor to Nautobot you will be writing unit tests to exercise the code you have written. Unit tests are not meant to test how the application behaves, only the individual blocks of code, therefore use of mock data and phony connections is common in unit test code. As a guiding principle, unit tests should be fast, because they will be executed quite often.

Unit tests are run using the `invoke unittest` command (if using the Docker development environment) or the `nautobot-server test` command:

| Docker Compose Workflow | Virtual Environment Workflow                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invoke unittest`       | `nautobot-server --config=nautobot/core/tests/nautobot_config.py test nautobot` |

!!! info
    By default `invoke unittest` will start and run the unit tests inside the Docker development container; this ensures that PostgreSQL and Redis servers are available during the test. However, if you have your environment configured such that `nautobot-server` can run locally, outside of the Docker environment, you may wish to set the environment variable `INVOKE_NAUTOBOT_LOCAL=True` to execute these tests in your local environment instead.

In cases where you haven't made any changes to the database (which is most of the time), you can append the `--keepdb` argument to this command to reuse the test database between runs. This cuts down on the time it takes to run the test suite since the database doesn't have to be rebuilt each time.

| Docker Compose Workflow    | Virtual Environment Workflow                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invoke unittest --keepdb` | `nautobot-server --config=nautobot/core/tests/nautobot_config.py test --keepdb nautobot` |

!!! note
    Using the `--keepdb` argument will raise errors if you've modified any model fields since the previous test run.

!!! warning
    In some cases when tests fail and exit uncleanly it may leave the test database in an inconsistent state. If you encounter errors about missing objects, remove `--keepdb` and run the tests again.

+/- 1.5.11
    The `--cache-test-fixtures` argument was added to the `invoke unittest` and `nautobot-server test` commands to allow for caching of test factory data between test runs. See the [factories documentation](./testing.md#factory-caching) for more information.

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests are automated tests written and run to ensure that the Nautobot application behaves as expected when being used as it would be in practice. By contrast to unit tests, where individual units of code are being tested, integration tests rely upon the server code actually running, and web UI clients or API clients to make real connections to the service to exercise actual workflows, such as navigating to the login page, filling out the username/passwords fields, and clicking the "Log In" button.

Running integrations tests requires the use of Docker at this time. They can be directly invoked using `nautobot-server test` just as unit tests can, however, a headless Firefox browser provided by Selenium is required. Because Selenium installation and setup is complicated, we have included a configuration for this to work out of the box using Docker.

The Selenium container is running a standalone, headless Firefox "web driver" browser that can be remotely controlled by Nautobot for use in integration testing.

Before running integration tests, the `selenium` container must be running. If you are using the Docker Compose workflow, it is automatically started for you. For the Virtual Environment workflow, you must start it manually.

| Docker Compose Workflow | Virtual Environment Workflow      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| (automatic)             | `invoke start --service selenium` |

Integration tests are run using the `invoke integration-test` command. All integration tests must inherit from `nautobot.core.testing.integration.SeleniumTestCase`, which itself is tagged with `integration`. A custom test runner has been implemented to automatically skip any test case tagged with `integration` by default, so normal unit tests run without any concern. To run the integration tests the `--tag integration` argument must be passed to `nautobot-server test`.

+/- 2.0.0
    `SeleniumTestCase` was moved from the `nautobot.utilities.testing.integration` module to `nautobot.core.testing.integration`.

| Docker Compose Workflow   | Virtual Environment Workflow                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invoke integration-test` | `nautobot-server --config=nautobot/core/tests/nautobot_config.py test --tag integration nautobot` |

!!! info
    The same arguments supported by `invoke unittest` are supported by `invoke integration-test`. The key difference being the dependency upon the Selenium container, and inclusion of the `integration` tag.

!!! tip
    You may also use `invoke integration-test` in the Virtual Environment workflow given that the `selenium` container is running, and that the `INVOKE_NAUTOBOT_LOCAL=True` environment variable has been set.

+/- 1.5.11
    The `--cache-test-fixtures` argument was added to the `invoke integration-test` and `nautobot-server test` commands to allow for caching of test factory data between test runs. See the [factories documentation](./testing.md#factory-caching) for more information.

##### Customizing Integration Test Executions

The following environment variables can be provided when running tests to customize where Nautobot looks for Selenium and where Selenium looks for Nautobot. If using the default setup documented above, there is no need to customize these.

* `NAUTOBOT_SELENIUM_URL` - The URL used by the Nautobot test runner to remotely control the headless Selenium Firefox node. You can provide your own, but it must be a [`Remote` WebDriver](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html#using-selenium-with-remote-webdriver). (Default: `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`; for Docker: `http://selenium:4444/wd/hub`)
* `NAUTOBOT_SELENIUM_HOST` - The hostname used by the Selenium WebDriver to access Nautobot using Firefox. (Default: `host.docker.internal`; for Docker: `nautobot`)

### Verifying the REST API Schema

If you make changes to the REST API, you should verify that the REST API OpenAPI schema renders correctly without errors. To verify that there are no errors, you can run the `invoke check-schema` command (if using the Docker development environment) or the `nautobot-server spectacular` command. In the latter case you should run the command for each supported REST API version that Nautobot provides (e.g. "1.2", "1.3")

| Docker Compose Workflow | Virtual Environment Workflow                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `invoke check-schema`   | `nautobot-server spectacular --api-version 1.2 --validate --fail-on-warn --file /dev/null` |

### Verifying Code Style and Static Analysis

To enforce best practices around consistent [coding style](style-guide.md), Nautobot uses [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/),  [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io). Additionally, [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) of Nautobot code is performed by [Pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/). You should run all of these commands and ensure that they pass fully with regard to your code changes before opening a pull request upstream.

| Docker Compose Workflow | Virtual Environment Workflow                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invoke flake8`         | `flake8`                                                                                                |
| `invoke black`          | `black`                                                                                                 |
| `invoke eslint`         | `npx eslint .`                                                                                          |
| `invoke prettier`       | `npx prettier -c .`                                                                                     |
| `invoke pylint`         | `nautobot-server pylint nautobot tasks.py && nautobot-server pylint --recursive development/ examples/` |

### Handling Migrations

#### Checking Whether a New Migration is Needed

If you're unsure whether a database schema migration is needed based on your changes, you can run the following command:

| Docker Compose Workflow   | Virtual Environment Workflow                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invoke check-migrations` | `nautobot-server --config=nautobot/core/tests/nautobot_config.py makemigrations --dry-run --check` |

#### Autogenerating Migrations

To generate new migrations if the above command indicates that a change is needed, you can run the following command:

| Docker Compose Workflow | Virtual Environment Workflow                                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invoke makemigrations` | `nautobot-server --config=nautobot/core/tests/nautobot_config.py makemigrations` |

If your branch modifies a Django model (and as a result requires a database schema modification), please be sure to provide a meaningful name to the migration before pushing.

* If you have yet to run `invoke makemigrations`, you can pass in a name for the migration with the `-n` option, example `invoke makemigrations -n provider_increase_account_length`.
* If you have already run `invoke makemigrations`, rename the generated migration files, for example `0004_provider_increase_account_length` instead of `0004_auto_20211220_2104`.

You’ll also want to run `black` against the generated migration file as the autogenerated code doesn’t follow our style guide by default.

When modifying model field attributes, modify the test data in the tests too to reflect these changes and also any forms which refer to the model.

#### Testing Migrations

Nautobot includes a number of data sets under the `development/datasets/` directory that represent various snapshots of historical database contents. You should validate whether your migrations correctly and successfully handle these datasets by running the `invoke migration-test --db-engine [postgres|mysql] --dataset development/datasets/<filename>` command (which handles both the Docker Compose workflow as well as the Virtual Environment workflow).

## Working on Documentation

Some features require documentation updates or new documentation to be written. The documentation files can be found in the `docs` directory. To preview these changes locally, you can use `mkdocs`.

For substantial changes to the code (including new features, removal of existing features, or significant changes in behavior) you should always make corresponding documentation updates. Nautobot's documentation pipeline includes a custom plugin for `mkdocs` that adds a few useful macros for annotating such changes:

* `+++ 1.4.3`, on a line by itself, is a shorthand for `!!! version-added "Added in version 1.4.3"`
* `+/- 1.4.3`, on a line by itself, is a shorthand for `!!! version-changed "Changed in version 1.4.3"`
* `--- 1.4.3`, on a line by itself, is a shorthand for `!!! version-removed "Removed in version 1.4.3"`

These admonitions in turn appear in the rendered documentation as follows:

+++ 1.4.3
+/- 1.4.3
--- 1.4.3

You can also add text to any of these admonitions for further clarity, for example:

    +++ 1.4.3
        The custom `mkdocs` plugin was added.

will render as:

+++ 1.4.3
    The custom `mkdocs` plugin was added.

!!! caution
    While you *can* use the `version-added` / `version-changed` / `version-removed` admonitions directly to add a custom title to a specific admonition, in general, you should use the macros for consistency across the documentation.

### Writing Documentation

You can preview the documentation using the server built into mkdocs, which should start a web server at `http://localhost:8001`.

| Docker Compose Workflow  | Virtual Environment Workflow |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `invoke start -s mkdocs` | `mkdocs serve`               |

Documentation is written in Markdown. If you need to add additional pages or sections to the documentation, you can add them to `mkdocs.yml` at the root of the repository.

### Verifying Documentation

Nautobot uses [`markdownlint-cli`](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) to verify correctness of the documentation. You should run this command and ensure that it passes fully with regard to your documentation changes before opening a pull request upstream.

| Docker Compose Workflow | Virtual Environment Workflow                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invoke markdownlint`   | `markdownlint --ignore nautobot/project-static --config .markdownlint.yml nautobot examples *.md` |

## Submitting Pull Requests

Once you're happy with your work and have verified that all tests pass, commit your changes and push it upstream to your fork. Always provide descriptive (but not excessively verbose) commit messages. When working on a specific issue, be sure to reference it.

```no-highlight
git commit -m "Closes #1234: Add IPv5 support"
git push origin
```

Once your fork has the new commit, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/compare) to the Nautobot repo to propose the changes. Be sure to provide a detailed accounting of the changes being made and the reasons for doing so.

Once submitted, a maintainer will review your pull request and either merge it or request changes. If changes are needed, you can make them via new commits to your fork: The pull request will update automatically.

!!! note
    Remember, pull requests are entertained only for **accepted** issues. If an issue you want to work on hasn't been approved by a maintainer yet, it's best to avoid risking your time and effort on a change that might not be accepted.

## Troubleshooting

Below are common issues you might encounter in your development environment and how to address them.

### FATAL: sorry, too many clients already

When using `nautobot-server runserver` to do development you might run into a traceback that looks something like this:

```no-highlight
Exception Type: OperationalError at /extras/tags/
Exception Value: FATAL:  sorry, too many clients already
```

The `runserver` development server is multi-threaded by default, which means that every request is creating its own connection. If you are doing some local testing or development that is resulting in a lot of connections to the database, pass `--nothreading` to the runserver command to disable threading:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server runserver --nothreading
```
