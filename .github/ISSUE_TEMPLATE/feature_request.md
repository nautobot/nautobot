    NOTE: IF YOUR ISSUE DOES NOT FOLLOW THIS TEMPLATE, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO
    UPDATE THE ISSUE IN ORDER TO HAVE IT REVIEWED.

    We follow an Agile User Story format for proposing new features or enhancements.

    Please take a moment to review the template below, as well as our established Nautobot
    Personas, which can be found here: https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/wiki/Personas

    Following this format helps us understand the target user(s) of the proposed feature,
    requirements necessary to meet the expected value, and ultimately implement the best
    solution.

    Developing good acceptance criteria is the key to getting the feature implemented
    in a way you expect to use the feature. This provides us insight into how you would
    ultimately use the feature in your workflow.

    This form is only for proposing specific new features or enhancements. If
    you have a general idea or question, please start a discussion instead:

    The story takes the form of the following template:
    ======================================================

    As a ___WHO, the user persona___,
    
    I want ___WHAT, the desired functionality to be implemented___,
    
    So that ___WHY, the reason or value of the implemented functionality___.
    
    I know this is done when... ___HOW, the requirements/acceptance criteria (a list) as
    to how this functionality should be implemented___.



    Example:
    ===========

    As ___P.D. the Plugin Developer___,  

    I want ___to develop Nautobot plugins that can be inserted as a top-level item in
    the navigation bar___,

    So that ___my plugin is seen as first-class citizen by my users and so that the
    plugins drop-down menu isn't overloaded.  When I use Nautobot as an App Platform,
    it'll also provide more focus on the Plugins/Apps than core SoT drop-downs (for
    users that aren't permitted to view those items)___.

    I know this is done when:

      - ___I create a Nautobot plugin and have the option to inject it in the Plugins
      dropdown menu or create a new dedicated dropdown in the navigation bar.___
      - ___When multiple plugins provide dedicated dropdowns, I can re-order the plugin
      dropdowns in the navbar.___
