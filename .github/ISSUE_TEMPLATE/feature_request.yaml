      placeholder: >
        My plugin is seen as first-class citizen by my users and so that the
        plugins drop-down menu isn't overloaded. When I use Nautobot as an App Platform,
        it'll also provide more focus on the Plugins/Apps than core SoT drop-downs (for
        users that aren't permitted to view those items)

        - I create a Nautobot plugin and have the option to inject it in the Plugins
          dropdown menu or create a new dedicated dropdown in the navigation bar.
          
        - When multiple plugins provide dedicated dropdowns, I can re-order the plugin
          dropdowns in the navbar.

      description: |
        To support this new feature, does the necessary data already exist, or would new
        models need to be created or additional fields on existing models need to be added?

        It is OK to state you are unsure if this would or would not require changes.

      label: External Dependencies
      description: |
        To support this new feature, would it require changing or introducing new dependencies
        on external libraries or services?

        It is OK to suggest an external library that could pose as a reference implementation
        or be installed directly.
