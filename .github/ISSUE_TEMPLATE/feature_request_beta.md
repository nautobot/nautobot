<!-- 
    NOTE: IF YOUR ISSUE DOES NOT FOLLOW THIS TEMPLATE, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO
    UPDATE THE ISSUE IN ORDER TO HAVE IT REVIEWED.

    This template is in beta. Target release date for this new template is July 6, 2021.
    At this time, the existing Feature Request template would be deprecated.

    This new template is following a common approach to writing Agile User Stories.
    Please note that it requires understanding and identifying the Nautobot Personas that are
    relevant for a given feature or enhancement. Personas are users who may 
    benefit or use a given feature.
    
    Please make sure to review the Nautobot Personas:
    https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/wiki/Personas

    This form is only for proposing specific new features or enhancements. If
    you have a general idea or question, please start a discussion instead:

    The user story needs to identify the **who** (user persona), **what**,
    **why**, and have user acceptance criteria.

    The story needs to follow the following template: As a [WHO], I want [WHAT], So that [WHY],

    I know this is done when... (list bullets)

    User Story Example:

    As P.D. the Plugin Developer,  
   		 # empty line
    I want to develop Nautobot plugins that can be inserted as a top-level
    item in the navigation bar,
   		 # empty line
    So that my plugin is seen as first-class citizen by my users and so that
    the plugins drop-down menu isn't overloaded.  When I use Nautobot as an
    App Platform, it'll also provide more focus on the Plugins/Apps than core
    SoT dropdowns (for users that aren't permitted to view those items).
 		   # empty line
    I know this is done when:

      * I create a Nautobot plugin and have the option to inject it in the _Plugins_
        dropdown menu or create a new dedicated dropdown in the navigation bar.
      * When multiple plugins provide dedicated dropdowns, I can re-order 
        the plugin dropdowns in the navbar. 

    More examples of user stories will be added in the Wiki prior to standardizing on this new template.

    Note any changes to the database schema that may be necessary to support the new
    feature. For example, does the proposal require adding a new model or field?
    (Not all new features require database changes.)

### Database Changes (Optional)


<!-- 
    List any new dependencies on external libraries or services that this new
    feature would introduce that you're aware of. For example, does the proposal require the
    installation of a new Python package? (Not all new features introduce new
    dependencies.)
