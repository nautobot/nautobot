        <i class="mdi mdi-alert"></i> <strong>Missing required packages</strong> - This installation of NetBox might be
        missing one or more required Python packages. These packages are listed in <code>requirements.txt</code> and
        <code>local_requirements.txt</code>, and are normally installed as part of the installation or upgrade process.
        To verify installed packages, run <code>pip freeze</code> from the console and compare the output to the list of
        required packages.

        <i class="mdi mdi-alert"></i> <strong>WSGI service not restarted after upgrade</strong> - If this installation
        has recently been upgraded, check that the WSGI service (e.g. gunicorn or uWSGI) has been restarted. This
