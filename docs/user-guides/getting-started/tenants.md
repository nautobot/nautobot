# Tenants

A 'Tenant' signifies ownership of an object in Nautobot and as such, any object may only have a single Tenant assigned.

More information on Tenants can be found in the [Tenants](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/tenancy/tenant/) section of the Nautobot docs.

## Creating a Tenant

To create a Tenant:

1. Click on **Organization** on the top navigation menu
2. Find **Tenants** and click on the `+`
3. Populate the `Name` field
4. The `Slug` field will auto-populate based on the `Name` field, but this can be manually overwritten
5. Click the `Create` button
