# Power Feed

A power feed identifies the power outlet/drop that goes to a rack and is terminated to a power panel. Power feeds have a supply type (AC/DC), voltage, amperage, and phase type (single/three).

Power feeds are optionally assigned to a rack. In addition, a power port may be connected to a power feed. In the context of a PDU, the power feed is analogous to the power outlet that a PDU's power port/inlet connects to.

!!! info
    The power usage of a rack is calculated when a power feed (or multiple) is assigned to that rack and connected to a power port.
