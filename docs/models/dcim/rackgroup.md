# Rack Groups

Racks can be organized into groups, which can be nested into themselves similar to regions. As with sites, how you choose to designate rack groups will depend on the nature of your organization. For example, if each site represents a campus, each group might represent a building within a campus. If each site represents a building, each rack group might equate to a floor or room.

Each rack group must be assigned to a parent site, and rack groups may optionally be nested within a site to model a multi-level hierarchy. For example, you might have a tier of rooms beneath a tier of floors, all belonging to the same parent building (site).

The name and facility ID of each rack within a group must be unique. (Racks not assigned to the same rack group may have identical names and/or facility IDs.)
