## v2.1.0 (2017-07-25)

### New Features

#### IP Address Roles ([#819](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/819))

The IP address model now supports the assignment of a functional role to help identify special-purpose IPs. These include:

* Loopback
* Secondary
* Anycast
* VIP
* VRRP
* HSRP
* GLBP

#### Automatic Provisioning of Next Available IP ([#1246](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1246))

A new API endpoint has been added at `/api/ipam/prefixes/<pk>/available-ips/`. A GET request to this endpoint will return a list of available IP addresses within the prefix (up to the pagination limit). A POST request will automatically create and return the next available IP address.

#### NAPALM Integration ([#1348](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1348))

The [NAPALM automation](https://napalm-automation.net/) library provides an abstracted interface for pulling live data (e.g. uptime, software version, running config, LLDP neighbors, etc.) from network devices. The NetBox API has been extended to support executing read-only NAPALM methods on devices defined in NetBox. To enable this functionality, ensure that NAPALM has been installed (`pip install napalm`) and the `NETBOX_USERNAME` and `NETBOX_PASSWORD` [configuration parameters](http://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration/optional-settings/#netbox_username) have been set in configuration.py.

### Enhancements

* [#838](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/838) - Display details of all objects being edited/deleted in bulk
* [#1041](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1041) - Added enabled and MTU fields to the interface model
* [#1121](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1121) - Added asset_tag and description fields to the InventoryItem model
* [#1141](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1141) - Include RD when listing VRFs in a form selection field
* [#1203](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1203) - Implemented query filters for all models
* [#1218](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1218) - Added IEEE 802.11 wireless interface types
* [#1269](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1269) - Added circuit termination to interface serializer
* [#1320](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1320) - Removed checkbox from confirmation dialog

### Bug Fixes

* [#1079](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1079) - Order interfaces naturally via API
* [#1285](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1285) - Enforce model validation when creating/editing objects via the API
* [#1358](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1358) - Correct VRF example values in IP/prefix import forms
* [#1362](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1362) - Raise validation error when attempting to create an API key that's too short
* [#1371](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1371) - Extend DeviceSerializer.parent_device to include standard fields

### API changes

* Added a new API endpoint which makes [NAPALM](https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm) accessible via NetBox
* Device components (console ports, power ports, interfaces, etc.) can only be filtered by a single device name or ID. This limitation was necessary to allow the natural ordering of interfaces according to the device's parent device type.
* Added two new fields to the interface serializer: `enabled` (boolean) and `mtu` (unsigned integer)
* Modified the interface serializer to include three discrete fields relating to connections: `is_connected` (boolean), `interface_connection`, and `circuit_termination`
* Added two new fields to the inventory item serializer: `asset_tag` and `description`
* Added "wireless" to interface type filter (in addition to physical, virtual, and LAG)
* Added a new endpoint at /api/ipam/prefixes/<pk>/available-ips/ to retrieve or create available IPs within a prefix
* Extended `parent_device` on DeviceSerializer to include the `url` and `display_name` of the parent Device, and the `url` of the DeviceBay
