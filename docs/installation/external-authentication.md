# External Authentication

This guide explains how to implement authentication using an external server. User authentication will fall back to built-in Django users in the event of a failure.

## Supported External Authentication Backends

- [LDAP Authentication](../configuration/authentication/ldap.md)
- [Remote User Authentication](../configuration/authentication/remote.md)
- [SSO Authentication](../configuration/authentication/sso.md)
