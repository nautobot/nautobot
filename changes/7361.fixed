Added a check in `refresh_job_code_from_repository()` to cause it to abort early if given a `repository_slug` that is invalid or conflicts with an installed Python package or Python built-in.
Fixed the code for loading Jobs from a GitRepository to only auto-import the `<repository_slug>` and `<repository_slug>.jobs` modules from `GIT_ROOT`, rather than loading all Python packages present in `GIT_ROOT`.
Fixed the code for loading Jobs from `JOBS_ROOT` and Git repositories to not import discovered packages/modules whose names are invalid as Python module names or whose names conflict with installed Python packages or Python built-ins. **This fix prevents some improper-but-previously-permitted names (e.g. `pass.py`, `nautobot.py`) from being imported.**
Added additional validation constraints on GitRepository `slug` to disallow values that would conflict with Python built-ins and keywords. **This fix will disallow some improper-but-previously-permitted slugs (e.g. `sys`, `pass`); you can run `nautobot-server validate_models extras.GitRepository` after upgrading to identify entries that should be deleted and recreated with a different slug.**
