Changed the `nautobot.apps.utils.get_base_template()` function's fallback behavior to return `"generic/object_retrieve.html"` instead of `"base.html"` in order to more correctly align with its usage throughout Nautobot core.
Replaced references to `generic/object_detail.html` with `generic/object_retrieve.html` throughout the code and docs, as `generic/object_detail.html` has been a deprecated alias since v1.4.0.
