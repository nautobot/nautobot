Changed nav menu items to collapse in a smooth animated way, rather than jumping 100% open immediately and covering menu items below. Previously opened menu items now collapse smoothly as well.
Changed nav menu so that menu expansion now pushes other menus below it downward rather than covering them (z axis).
Changed nav menu headers to not lose their color after a link was clicked.
Added nav menu state (expanded or closed) and scroll position to local storage, allowing it to be maintained on page refresh, link clicked, or page reload.
