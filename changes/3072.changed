In Nautobot's unit tests, all HTTP requests are now sent with SERVER_NAME set to `nautobot.example.com` instead of `testserver` (Django's default) and the test configuration for Nautobot itself sets `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to expect `nautobot.example.com`. This is intended to protect against issues such as #3065.
