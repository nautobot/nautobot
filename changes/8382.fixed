The nautobot.dcim.models.Device.all_modules property was previously used to look up related modules for multiple attributes (console ports, interfaces, power ports, module bays, etc.).
The underlying queryset can take 1–3 seconds to resolve parent modules, and this query was executed repeatedly when loading the Device Details page.

This PR addresses the issue by caching the all_modules primary keys in a temporary property, which related port types and module bays can reference. This eliminates redundant all_modules queries during Device Details page rendering.
