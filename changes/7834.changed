Changed UI behavior when creating/editing Dynamic Groups to no longer synchronously (re)calculate the members of the group on form submission, as this could cause page timeouts when a large number of members need to be added or removed. This functionality is replaced by a Job Button on the detail view that can be clicked to asynchronously refresh the members cache on demand instead.
