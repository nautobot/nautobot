Fixed data mismatch in `ScheduledJob` causing celery workers to fail when running scheduled jobs created in versions prior to `v1.5.8`. âš  **NOTE**: If your celery workers are failing on startup after upgrading to `v1.5.8`, you may need to purge the celery queue with `nautobot-server celery purge` or `nautobot-server celery purge -Q <queues>` to purge custom queues.
