The `Region`, `RackGroup`, `TenantGroup`, and `InventoryItem` models are now based on `django-tree-queries` instead of `django-mptt`. This does change the API for certain tree operations on these models, for example `get_ancestors()` is now `ancestors()` and `get_descendants()` is now `descendants()`.
The UI and REST API for `Region`, `RackGroup`, and `TenantGroup` now provide only the related count of objects (e.g. `site_count` for `Region`) that are directly related to each instance. Formerly they provided a cumulative total including objects related to its descendants as well.
Renamed field `_depth` to `tree_depth` in the REST API for `Region`, `RackGroup`, `TenantGroup`, and `InventoryItem`.
Renamed InventoryItem database relation `child_items` and filter fields `child_items` and `has_child_items` to `children` and `has_children` respectively.
