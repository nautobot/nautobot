Added pre-check migration (`extras.0125_approval_workflow_pre_check`) to validate data consistency before removing the `approval_required flag` from Job models. The migration aborts with a clear error message if any scheduled jobs still have `approval_required=True`. If any jobs (but not scheduled jobs) still have the flag set, a warning is printed advising to migrate them to the new approval workflow after the upgrade is completed.
