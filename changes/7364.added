Added pre-check migration (0125_remove_job_approval_required_pre_check.py) to validate data consistency before removing the approval_required flag from Job models. The migration aborts with a clear error message if any scheduled jobs still have `approval_required=True`. If any jobs (but not scheduled jobs) still have the flag set, a warning is printed advising to migrate them to the new approval workflow.
