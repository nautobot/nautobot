Updated defaults in `settings.py` to more closely align to the documentation. If you're using a configuration file generated by `nautobot-server init`, these changes should have no impact, but if you have a manually crafted configuration file, please verify that the configuration of your system is still as expected after upgrading, with a particular focus on the database configuration, `SECRET_KEY`, and `LOGGING`.
Changed the default `LOGGING` configuration for virtualenv installs to be the same as it is for Nautobot's published Docker images.
Revised the template for new configurations generated by `nautobot-server init` to have less redundancy with Nautobot's built-in `settings.py`.
