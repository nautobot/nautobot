Replaced `mime-support` with `media-types` in Dockerfile dependencies. The `mime-support` package is no longer available in newer Debian-based python:slim images (starting with Debian 13 "Trixie"). For the same reason, the `xmlsec` dependency was upgraded to version `1.3.16` to ensure compatibility with the updated build environment.
