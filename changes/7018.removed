As a consequence of upgrading to Django 5.2, necessarily removed support for customizing date/time display in the UI through `nautobot_config.py` settings `DATE_FORMAT`, `DATETIME_FORMAT`, `TIME_FORMAT`, `SHORT_DATE_FORMAT`, and `SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT`. Formatting of date/time information is now controlled by the application-level `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting and/or by per-user language preferences.
