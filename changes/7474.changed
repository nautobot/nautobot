Simplified `runnable` property logic in the Job model: removed check for `has_sensitive_variable`s and `approval_required`. Now only depends on `enabled` and `installed` flags.
Changed the `post` method in `JobRunView` and the `run` action in `JobViewSetBase` to check for an approval workflow on the scheduled job instead of using `approval_required`.
