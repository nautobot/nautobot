Changed Prefix validation logic to prevent changing the `prefix` (`network`, `broadcast`, `prefix_length`, `ip_version`) of an existing Prefix record, similar to how IP Address `address` is immutable after creation. This prevents a class of issues with incorrect database data after editing a Prefix.
Changed Prefix update logic so that moving a Prefix to a different Namespace now carries along its descendant Prefixes and their associated IP Addresses as well, instead of only carrying along its direct child IP Addresses and leaving behind the other descendants in the original Namespace.
