Added REST API support for an `?exclude_m2m=true` query parameter. Specifying this parameter prevents the API from retrieving and serializing many-to-many relations on the requested object(s) (for example, the list of all Prefixes associated with a given VRF), which can in some cases greatly improve the performance of the API and reduce memory and network overhead substantially.
Added automatic optimization of REST API querysets via appropriate `select_related` and `prefetch_related` calls.
Enhanced generic REST API test methods `ListObjectsViewTestCase.test_list_objects_depth_0` and `ListObjectsViewTestCase.test_list_objects_depth_1` to test the `?exclude_m2m=true` query parameter. This enhancement includes checks for missing related fields in the serialized data, which may result in new test failures being seen in Apps using this test class.
Enhanced generic REST API test method `UpdateObjectViewTestCase.test_update_object` to include an idempotency test in combination with the `?exclude_m2m=true` query parameter. This may result in new test failures being seen in Apps using this test class.
