Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoint `/extras/job-results/<uuid:pk>/log-table/`; furthermore it will not allow an authenticated user to view log entries for a JobResult they don't otherwise have permission to view. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
Added narrower permissions enforcement on the endpoints `/extras/git-repositories/<uuid:pk>/sync/` and `/extras/git-repositories/<uuid:pk>/dry-run/`; a user who has `change` permissions for a subset of Git repositories is no longer permitted to sync or dry-run other repositories for which they lack the appropriate permissions. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
Added narrower permissions enforcement on the `/api/dcim/connected-device/?peer_device=...&?peer_interface=...` REST API endpoint; a user who has `view` permissions for a subset of interfaces is no longer permitted to query other interfaces for which they lack permissions. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
Added narrower permissions enforcement on all `<app>/<model>/<uuid>/notes/` UI endpoints; a user must now have the appropriate `extras.view_note` permissions to view existing notes. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
Added requirement for user authentication to access the REST API endpoints `/api/redoc/`, `/api/swagger/`, `/api/swagger.json`, and `/api/swagger.yaml`. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
Added requirement for user authentication to access the `/api/graphql` REST API endpoint, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoints `/dcim/racks/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/dcim/devices/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/prefixes/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/ip-addresses/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/virtualization/clusters/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, and `/virtualization/virtual-machines/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoint `/extras/secrets/provider/<str:provider_slug>/form/`. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
