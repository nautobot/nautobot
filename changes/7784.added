Added support for `ObjectFieldsPanel(...fields="__all__", additional_fields=[...])` to allow inclusion of properties, reverse relations, nested lookups, and other attributes not normally included in `__all__`.
Enhanced `ObjectFieldsPanel` to support nested lookup of object fields, such as `fields=["rack__rack_group"]`.
