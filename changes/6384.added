Added `Job.logger.failure()` API for Job logging, using custom `FAILURE` log level (between `WARNING` and `ERROR`).
Added `Job.fail()` API, which can be used to fail a Job more gracefully than by raising an uncaught exception.
Added `NautobotTestCaseMixin.assertJobResultStatus()` testing helper API.
